## What's Here

This archive preserves the project's development history, including phase reports, sprint summaries, implementation notes, and session handoffs from the original development process.

## Organization

- **phases/** - Phase completion reports (PHASE1-5)
- **sprints/** - Sprint summaries and reports (R1-R6, R9)
- **sessions/** - Session handoff notes and progress reports
- **implementation-reports/** - Detailed implementation and integration reports
- **Root files** - Miscellaneous historical documents

## Note on Historical Documents

These documents were created during the project's development and may contain:

- Outdated information or metrics
- Experimental features that were not implemented
- Implementation details that have since changed
- Session-specific context and handoff notes

They are preserved for historical reference and to understand the project's evolution, but should not be considered current documentation.

## Key Historical Milestones

- Phase 1: Stable Entity IDs (EID)
- Phase 2: Binary HERT Format
- Phase 3: Alias Resolution (AID)
- Phase 4: Sense Disambiguation (SP)
- Phase 5: Query & Retrieval API

### Sprint Deliveries
- Sprint R1-R3: Initial development
- Sprint R4: Console expansion
- Sprint R5: Enhancements
- Sprint R6: Insight & Scale (graph viz, search, bulk review, performance)
- Sprint R9: Additional features

### Engine Evolution
- Phase E1: Confidence-based entity filtering
- Phase E2: Coreference resolution infrastructure
- Phase E3: Narrative relation extraction
- Phase E4: Coreference integration (explored)

## Consolidation

In January 2025, the documentation was consolidated from ~50 scattered markdown files into a coherent, well-organized structure. This archive preserves the original documents for reference.
