The Last Summer

Dr. Sarah Chen sat in her office at Boston Memorial Hospital, staring at the resignation letter on her screen. After fifteen years as head of oncology, she was finally admitting what everyone else had known for months: she was burned out. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows across her desk piled high with patient files and medical journals.

"You're actually doing it," said a voice from the doorway. Sarah looked up to see Dr. Marcus Williams, her colleague and closest friend at the hospital. He had been chief of surgery for a decade, and they had weathered countless crises together—budget cuts, staff shortages, the pandemic.

"I have to," Sarah replied, rubbing her tired eyes. "Last week I almost prescribed the wrong dosage for Mrs. Patterson. Marcus, I could have killed her. My concentration is shot."

Marcus entered the office and sat down across from her. "You caught the error before it went through. That's what matters. You're being too hard on yourself."

"Am I? I barely remember my daughter Lily's school play last month. I forgot my husband David's birthday. I haven't slept more than four hours a night in years." Sarah's voice cracked. "I became a doctor to save lives, but I'm losing my own life in the process."

Marcus was quiet for a moment. "Where will you go?"

"David inherited his grandmother's cottage in Maine. Oceanside, quiet. We're thinking of moving there. I could work at the local clinic, if they'll have me. Part-time. Lily could go to school in a place where she actually sees her mother."

"Maine," Marcus said wistfully. "I went there once as a kid. My father took me fishing off the coast. We stayed in this little town called Seabrook. Beautiful place."

"That's actually where the cottage is," Sarah said with a slight smile. "Seabrook. Population three thousand. One traffic light. Complete opposite of Boston."

That night, Sarah went home to their apartment in Cambridge and told her family the news. David, a software engineer who worked remotely, was immediately supportive. "I've been ready for this for years," he admitted. "I can work from anywhere with internet. And honestly, I miss having actual space. Here we're crammed into nine hundred square feet."

Twelve-year-old Lily was less enthusiastic. "But all my friends are here! And my school, and my soccer team. You're making me move to nowhere?"

"It's not nowhere," Sarah said gently. "It's a real town with real people and a good school. You'll make new friends."

"I don't want new friends. I want my friends." Lily stormed off to her room and slammed the door—a punctuation mark Sarah was all too familiar with these days.

David squeezed Sarah's hand. "She'll adjust. Kids are resilient. Remember when we moved her from daycare to kindergarten? Same drama, but within a week she loved it."

"I hope you're right," Sarah said. But doubt gnawed at her. Was she being selfish? Imposing her burnout crisis on her whole family?

The next week, Sarah submitted her resignation to hospital administrator Patricia Monroe. Patricia, a no-nonsense woman in her sixties who had run Boston Memorial for twenty years, didn't try to change Sarah's mind.

"I saw this coming," Patricia said bluntly. "You've been running on fumes for two years. I should have intervened, but I was afraid to lose you. Selfish of me."

"I'll stay through the end of summer," Sarah offered. "Help find and train my replacement."

"Dr. Jennifer Park from Johns Hopkins has applied. Young, brilliant, eager. She'd be perfect. Can you mentor her for the last two months?"

Sarah agreed. Dr. Park arrived the following week—a thirty-two-year-old prodigy who had published groundbreaking research on immunotherapy. She reminded Sarah of herself fifteen years ago: passionate, idealistic, convinced she could change the world.

"The key is building trust with patients," Sarah explained during Park's first week. "Medicine is as much about listening as diagnosing. Take Mrs. Agnes Foster in 412—she's been my patient for seven years. Stage four breast cancer, defied all the odds. Know why? Because she trusts me completely. She takes her meds because I explain everything, answer every question, treat her like a person not a case number."

Jennifer nodded eagerly, taking notes. "My professors at Johns Hopkins said you were legendary. That you have an almost ninety percent patient satisfaction rate."

"Had," Sarah corrected. "Had ninety percent. Lately I've been distracted, distant. Patients notice. They deserve better."

Over the summer, Sarah gradually transitioned her patient load to Jennifer while the Chen family prepared for the move. David drove up to Seabrook several times to get the cottage ready—it had been empty since Grandmother Rose died three years ago. He sent photos: a charming two-story house with blue shutters, a wraparound porch, and a view of the Atlantic Ocean.

Lily remained sullen but slowly warmed to the idea when she learned Seabrook had a marine biology summer camp. "I guess that's cool," she admitted reluctantly. "Can I take sailing lessons?"

"Absolutely," Sarah promised.

Sarah's brother Tom flew in from San Francisco to say goodbye. Tom was a venture capitalist, wealthy and perpetually stressed—he understood burnout all too well. Over dinner at their favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Allston, he confessed his own struggles.

"I'm funding my third startup this year," Tom said. "All of them are failing. I'm hemorrhaging money, and my partners want me out. My wife Jennifer is talking about divorce."

"I'm sorry, Tom. I didn't know things were that bad."

"I don't advertise it. The successful venture capitalist image is everything in my business. But honestly? I envy you. You're making a brave choice, prioritizing what matters. I'm too much of a coward."

"It's not cowardice," Sarah said. "It's circumstances. But Tom, if Jennifer is unhappy, talk to her. Don't let your marriage fall apart because you're too proud to admit you need help."

Tom promised he would try.

August arrived, bringing Sarah's last week at Boston Memorial. The staff threw her a farewell party in the hospital cafeteria. Marcus gave a toast that brought tears to her eyes.

"Dr. Sarah Chen is the best oncologist I've ever worked with," Marcus said, raising his glass. "But more than that, she's the best person. She stayed late with frightened patients, attended every single staff birthday party, advocated for nurse raises when administration wanted cuts. Sarah, you've made this hospital better, and we're going to miss you terribly."

Colleagues came up to hug her, share memories. Nurses gave her a scrapbook filled with photos and thank-you notes. Even Patricia Monroe looked misty-eyed.

On Sarah's final day, she made rounds one last time. Mrs. Foster grabbed her hand with surprising strength. "You're really leaving?"

"I am. But Dr. Park is wonderful. She'll take excellent care of you."

"Will you come visit?"

"I will," Sarah promised. "And you have my email. Keep me updated on how you're doing."

The Chen family loaded their belongings into a moving truck and began the drive north. Interstate 95 carried them out of Boston, through New Hampshire, into Maine. The landscape shifted from urban sprawl to forests and farmland. Lily put in her earbuds and stared out the window, still processing the change.

They arrived in Seabrook on a brilliant September afternoon. The cottage looked even better than the photos—fresh white paint, a garden of wildflowers, the ocean glittering beyond. Neighbors came over to introduce themselves: elderly Harold Jenkins who ran the hardware store, young couple Emma and Jason Torres who owned the local bookstore, and Martha Quinn, the elementary school principal who would be Lily's new boss, so to speak.

"Welcome to Seabrook," Martha said warmly. "Lily, I think you'll love our school. We have an excellent marine science program, and we're small enough that every student gets personal attention."

Over the next weeks, the Chen family settled into their new life. Sarah met with Dr. Robert Sullivan, who ran Seabrook Medical Clinic. Sullivan was in his late sixties, semi-retired, and desperately needed help.

"I'm the only doctor for thirty miles," Sullivan explained. "I handle everything from broken bones to chronic disease management. I could really use someone with your expertise, especially for cancer patients. Right now I have to refer them to Portland, which is a two-hour drive."

"I'm only looking for part-time," Sarah warned.

"Twenty hours a week would be a godsend. Please say yes."

Sarah agreed. The clinic was nothing like Boston Memorial—no advanced imaging equipment, limited lab capabilities, a staff of just three nurses. But it had something the hospital had lost: a sense of community. Sarah recognized patients from around town. She treated Harold Jenkins for his diabetes, Emma Torres for her pregnancy, local fisherman Patrick O'Malley for his chronic back pain.

The pace was slower, less intense. Sarah found herself actually listening to patients, hearing about their families, their jobs, their lives beyond their medical conditions. She remembered why she had become a doctor in the first place—to help people, not just treat diseases.

Lily adjusted too, though not without bumps. She joined the middle school soccer team and slowly made friends with girls like Rachel Morrison and Sophie Kim. The marine biology program captured her imagination—she spent hours studying tide pools and learning about local ecosystems.

One evening in October, the Chen family sat on their porch watching the sunset over the Atlantic. David had his laptop but wasn't working for once. Lily was reading a book about whales. Sarah was simply enjoying the sound of the waves.

"I think I was wrong," Lily admitted. "This place is actually pretty cool."

David laughed. "High praise from a twelve-year-old."

"I'm serious. Like, today in science class we dissected squid that Mr. Peterson caught this morning. When would I ever do that in Boston?"

Sarah felt something she hadn't experienced in years: contentment. No racing thoughts about patient charts. No anxiety about hospital politics. No guilt about missing family moments. Just peace.

Her phone buzzed—a text from Marcus. "Mrs. Foster is asking for you. Could you call her?"

Sarah dialed immediately. "Agnes, are you okay?"

Mrs. Foster's familiar voice crackled over the line. "Oh, I'm fine, dear. Dr. Park is taking wonderful care of me, just like you said. I just wanted to tell you that my scans came back clean. Remission, after all these years. I wanted you to know."

Tears sprang to Sarah's eyes. "Agnes, that's wonderful. I'm so happy for you."

"Thank you for everything, Dr. Chen. You gave me hope when I had none. That's a gift I can never repay."

After they hung up, David noticed Sarah crying and immediately grew concerned. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong," Sarah said, smiling through her tears. "Everything's right. For the first time in a long time, everything is exactly right."

As autumn deepened into winter, Sarah discovered rhythms she had forgotten existed: morning walks on the beach, family dinners every night, reading before bed instead of reviewing case files. She started painting again—a hobby from her college days she had abandoned for lack of time. Her landscapes were clumsy at first, but she improved with practice.

The clinic became a source of joy rather than stress. When teenager Kyle Anderson came in with suspicious symptoms, Sarah's oncology expertise allowed her to diagnose early-stage lymphoma. She coordinated his treatment with specialists in Portland, but provided local support and monitoring. Kyle's mother, Susan Anderson, was overwhelmed with gratitude.

"In a bigger city, he might have slipped through the cracks," Susan said. "But here, you know us. You paid attention. You saved my son's life."

Sarah realized this was the impact she had wanted all along—personal, meaningful, sustainable. Not the volume medicine of Boston Memorial, where she saw forty patients a day and remembered none of their names by evening.

Christmas in Seabrook was magical. Snow covered the cottage, and the town square featured a tree-lighting ceremony where everyone gathered. Lily sang in the school choir. David helped organize a charity drive for fishing families hit by storms. Sarah volunteered at the clinic's free flu shot day.

On Christmas Eve, Sarah received a call from Jennifer Park. "I just wanted to thank you," Jennifer said. "Your mentorship made all the difference. I'm loving the work at Boston Memorial, but I'm also implementing boundaries you taught me. I leave by six every day, no matter what. I take weekends off. I'm not going to burn out like... well, like you did."

"That's exactly what I hoped," Sarah said. "Learn from my mistakes."

Tom called too, with better news. He and his wife Jennifer had started couples therapy. He had stepped back from the venture capital firm to work as a consultant—fewer hours, less stress, more time for family. "You inspired me, sis. Life's too short to spend it miserable."

As midnight approached, the Chen family walked down to the beach. The Atlantic was calm, moonlight shimmering on the water. They stood together, watching the year turn.

"This was the best decision we ever made," David said.

Lily nodded. "I don't even miss Boston anymore. Well, maybe the pizza. The pizza here is terrible."

Sarah laughed. "We'll visit. Get your pizza fix. But this... this is home now."

In that moment, standing between her husband and daughter with cold sand beneath her feet and salt air in her lungs, Sarah felt a completeness she had been chasing for fifteen years. She had spent so long running toward something—prestige, success, accomplishment—that she had almost run right past what mattered.

She thought about all her patients over the years, the lives saved, the comfort provided. That work had meaning. But so did this: being present for her daughter's childhood, maintaining her marriage, taking care of herself so she could keep taking care of others.

The last summer had turned into a new beginning. And Sarah Chen, who had spent her career fighting death, finally learned how to live.
