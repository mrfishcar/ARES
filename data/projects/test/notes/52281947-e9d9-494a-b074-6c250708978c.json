Mildred, ever cautious, warned him that \nthe clock had struck thirteen once before — on the night Frederick vanished.\n\nLater that evening, Barty recorded in his journal that he had seen a faint green light pulse behind the tower’s face. \nHe wrote, “The sound was like breathing.” [[Entity: Melora Graves|type=PERSON]] later confirmed seeing the same glow \nfrom her window at [[Entity: Thornbridge House|type=PLACE]].\n\nBy dawn, the clock tower stood silent again. Yet witnesses swore that the second hand trembled, as if resisting the dawn.\n\n#seeds\n- Quotation from Barty’s journal dated March 14, 1903.\n- Statement from Melora Graves to the Wickersham Gazette.\n- Parish record confirming the clock tower fire (April 1887).\n\n#tags\n[[Entity: Wickersham Clock Tower|type=PLACE]], [[Entity: Wickersham Gazette|type=ORG]], [[Entity: Great Fire of 1887|type=EVENT]]",
