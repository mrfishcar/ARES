  "markdown": "The Fellowship of the Ring began their quest in Rivendell during the\n  Council of Elrond. Frodo Baggins carried the One Ring, while Gandalf the\n  Grey guided them through Moria. They faced the Balrog at the Bridge of\n  Khazad-dûm.\n\n  Later, Aragorn son of Arathorn led them to Lothlórien, where Galadriel\n  showed them the Mirror. The Company sailed down the Anduin River before\n  reaching Amon Hen.\n\n  In the modern world, Professor Tolkien created Middle-earth at Oxford\n  University. The books were published by Allen & Unwin in 1954.",
