The council included representatives from all the Free Peoples\n  of Middle-earth.\n\n  ## Key Members\n\n  Gandalf the Grey led the fellowship on their quest to destroy the One\n  Ring. The wizard had traveled extensively throughout Middle-earth and\n  possessed great wisdom.\n\n  Aragorn, the heir of Isildur, joined as the group's ranger and guide. He\n  would later become King of Gondor after the War of the Ring.\n\n  The hobbits Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck, and Pippin\n  Took represented the Shire. Frodo carried the burden of the Ring itself.\n\n  ## The Quest\n\n  The fellowship departed from Rivendell and traveled through dangerous\n  lands. They passed through Moria, where they faced the Balrog in the Mines\n   of Moria.\n\n  After crossing through Lothlórien, they journeyed down the River Anduin.\n  The Lady Galadriel had warned them of the trials ahead.\n\n  The fellowship eventually broke at Amon Hen, where Boromir fell to the\n  Ring's temptation and Frodo decided to continue alone with Sam.\n\n  ## Major Events\n\n  - The Battle of Helm's Deep tested the strength of Rohan\n  - The Siege of Gondor threatened Minas Tirith\n  - The destruction of the Ring at Mount Doom ended Sauron's reign\n\n  The courage and friendship displayed throughout this journey would be\n  remembered for ages.\n",
