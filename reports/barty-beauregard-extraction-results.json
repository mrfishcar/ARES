        "text": "and the Fabulous Fraud\r\r\rCory Allen Gilford\n\nCHAPTER ONE\rSong for the City, No. 12.\r      In the City, a house emanates music both day and night. Most never hear it. How could they? The song has played longer than most of the citizens have been alive. Some do hear the music, but all who have ears to hear wish they had not. Through its beautiful hum, it resonates doom in the hearts of its hearers. If ever you hear the chords, cover your ears. Only dread comes from those notes.\r      They drift from a record player, set upon a well-used chair. Perched on the rooftop, above majestic oaks lining the street below, it watches the city. No power cable feeds it life. Though it bears marks of age, its tune sounds new. Through wind, rain, sun, and frost, it plays on, masking itself in monotony and consistency. The spinning label reads �Song for the City, No. 12.�\r      The house has stood long before even the oldest city residents. Like the song, one could walk past the beautiful white columns, the trim and molding, the tediously carved decor and gold accents, and the tiger statue that guards the front garden, and disregard its ominous presence. Though the house is beautiful, its beauty could never mask the silent threat it impresses on its viewers. The sign on the front gate reads, �You are welcome here,� but the spear heads on the fence utter something entirely different: �You will die here.�\r      Should you miss the warning given by the bars, the main door has another message shrouded in beauty. In the middle of the tall, black wood, an inscription carved on a gold placard reads, �Many come to stay, few ever leave.��\r      It was to this door that the mail carrier walked, drawn by the familiar, yet forgotten, song. And when he finally heard it, he wished at once that he had not.�\r      He did not intend, that day, to stop at number 6067. He could not, in truth, recall ever seeing the house before. Sitting in his government-issued mail-truck, he studied the bars, the columns, and the tiger. He felt a powerful desire to look away but could not. He, at once, felt bathed in dread and curiosity. Where had this house been all the months that he worked this route?\r      The reasonable part of his brain thought, I can�t notice every house. That voice wavered, unsure of itself. Something about the house disquieted his soul. It knows.\r      His inner voice questioned. I must have dropped off mail here before. Maybe. He searched the front porch. Maybe I should knock.\r      He killed his truck�s ignition, and the engine slowed to silence.\r      No� Why would they be expecting me? I�ve never seen this house before. I�ve never met these people. He glanced at the tiger, which looked ready to pounce on its prey.\r      She looks precious!\r      The tiger did not, in fact, look precious. Becoming ever lost in his stupor, he had convinced himself that she was lovely. The claws�perfect for scratching his back. The eyes had no pupils, but they looked like they were longing for long walks on the beach. Of course, none of this made sense.\r      He stepped out of the truck onto the sidewalk in front of the house. When he stood straight, he appeared lanky and too tall to drive the vehicle from which he emerged. His clothes looked a size too small, but only because the correct size did not exist.\r      You know, I should meet these lovely people!�I am their mailman, after all. It�s my duty to get to know the people I serve.\r      And with this small consideration, Frederick the mailman swung open the black gate that read �you are welcome here.� He walked, sure that he was, indeed, welcome there.\r      He straightened his collar and brushed his shorts. His hand rubbed his bald head, brushing back imaginary hair. He resembled someone preparing for a job interview.\r      He walked the broken concrete path that led to the stairs of the stoop, each step burdened with anxiety. Yet, he could not help himself. He looked to his left and met eyes with an elderly woman watering the lawn next door. She stared only a moment before snapping her head to look away. Maybe she wanted to avoid seeing what would inevitably happen. I�m being paranoid.\r      But why should he not turn around and march back to the truck? Why not leave this residence alone and continue his route? Did he really have a reason to knock on their door? Would this unplanned visit bother them?�\r      I�m just going to head out, he thought, resolving to abandon his congeniality. This seemed right.\r      But something also seemed wrong. He had made up his mind, but his feet would not obey. They continued marching onward, resolute in their goal. He tried to look down at his feet, but his head remained locked, fixed on the door. As one trapped in a dream, Frederick spectated someone else�s perspective in his own body. \r      His fear surged. He could think only of a few conditions that might cause a lack of control in his limbs: a stroke, an aneurism, or a� a dream. The mail carrier must have been experiencing some sort of psychotic episode. This option, however unpleasant, brought some reassurance. Something natural seemed better than something supernatural, for an evil presence hung in the air.\r      He had to do something�anything. The woman, he thought. She could help.\r      His legs ceased their movement. He prayed desperately that this happened due to his own will. His head slowly swiveled to his left. He could see the lady, still watering her lawn. He tried to talk, but his lips failed to form the words. In his mind, he began repeating, Help! Please help me! Hello! God! Help me, please! He hoped thinking these words would make the sound come out of his mouth. They did not.\r      Instead, his body stood, staring at the woman. When she could ignore him no longer, she turned to address him. With a tone of polite confusion, she bellowed, �Hey, hon. You need something?�\r      I need help. I can�t control my body. My arms� my legs� They aren�t working. Call someone. Please!�\r      Nothing. No words formed on his lips.\r       �Yes?� she called louder. �Can I help you with something?�\r      He had given her the creeps; he felt sure. Frederick, a stranger, stared at her in silence. He empathized with her plain discomfort.\r      He felt movement in his face, but not because he had wished for it. A smile formed, a dark, slow, sinister grin. Then, his mouth opened. Frederick heard words come out, but not words he commanded.\r      �Honey, If I were any better,� he said smoothly. �I�d be dead.��\r      That�s not right, he said in his mind. The lady smiled awkwardly, nodded, and returned to her work. His head slowly turned back to face the stoop and front porch. Then, his feet began walking again, Frederick a prisoner in his own body.\r      He made quick work of the stairs leading to the covered porch and front door. He pulled back on the knocker, quite unintentionally, and slammed it into the door. The force of the knocker resonated through the dark wood. The placard that read �Many come to stay, few ever leave.� now seemed to glow in the darkness of the porch.\r      The door opened on its own, the words of the sign shrinking into the wall of the entryway. A voice, echoing in the cold of the house, said, �Come in and close the door quickly.� The last thing Frederick wanted to do was enter this house. Still, he obeyed, blinded by eyes unaccustomed to the darkness engulfing him.\r      As his eyes adjusted, he could see that he walked a long, dark hallway. Caged wall lamps dimly lit aged stone brick walls with blue light. After a thousand steps, the hallway opened into a large, circular room, arranged like a small arena. In the middle of the room, a dark body of still water, as big as a home swimming pool, perfectly reflected light from the ceiling. The brick of the wall faded as it rose, becoming a night sky. A small model of the moon glowed, hovering thirty feet above the water.\r      On the other side of the pool, stairs led to an upper level that circled around the room. Ten grandiose looking chairs sat in two groups arranged equally on both sides of the upper ring. At the top of the stairs, a grand, unlit, fireplace served as a backdrop for a throne. Between each chair, torches hung on the wall, waiting to provide light should the room need use.\r      You belong to me now.\r      The words echoed in Fredericks mind.\r      In a flash, a large mirror appeared on the opposite end of the pool. In the golden frame, he saw himself drenched in sweat. Frederick blinked, and a dark shadow of a man grabbed his reflection and slowly slit its throat. Blood tricked out along his neck, covering his uniform. He watched as his doppelganger slowly fell from the frame and dropped into the water, creating ripples that distorted the moon�s mirrored image.\r      Frederick let out a scream, now fully in control of his head. He turned left and right, surveying the room in full panic. �Where are you?!�\r      �Shh,� a voice whispered behind him, breathing deep on his neck. It sounded hoarse, and low. �Don�t disturb the quiet.�\r      Frederick, now hyperventilating, shivering, �What did you do to me?�\r      The demonic figure circled Frederick�s frozen body to stare at him straight on. �Not a damn thing.� It lifted a cigarette and blew into it. The end glowed orange in obedience.\r      When the being moved, it seemed to float. The demon, for no other word seemed appropriate, appeared as a man hidden in shadow. Where skin should have reflected the moonlight, shadow covered his face. White light shone from where eyes should be. Smoke formed the shape of his head and drifted into the air. It carried a long cane with its right hand. A dark, silver snake twisted around the head of the cane and seemed to run across the demon�s hand seamlessly.\r      �Not yet.� He straightened the collar of a silky, all black suit. His hands shone like polished tungsten. �I apologize for the inconvenience, Frederick.� Upon hearing his name, the mail carrier�s heart skipped a beat.\r      �Would you like a drink?� the demon asked. �Some water, perhaps? No? I just want to make sure you�re alright. I�m afraid I�ll be detaining you indefinitely. I have some questions for you.�\r      �What questions?� Frederick asked, still very much afraid.\r      The demon began walking back and forth, as a man pacing in thought. �Questions that I suspect I already know the answers to.�\r      Frederick, completely awestruck, responded. �How do you know my name?�\r      The being paused its movements for a moment. �I know a lot of things. That�s hardly impressive, Freddy.� Fredericks name trailed off and echoed like a low moan. �Something�s been bothering me for a while. Something hasn�t been quite right. I�m a man that likes knowing what to expect, you see. Ten or so years ago, some interesting things started happening that, until lately, I haven�t been able to explain.�\r      The tone in which this demon spoke struck Frederick as curious and conversational, almost genuine. This smooth-talking voice sent shivers through the mail carrier. �I d-don�t understand. What does this have to do with me?�\r      �I think a lot, actually, dear friend,� the demon continued. �Listen, Freddy. I�ve got power. But I know what to do with it. Some people don�t. You can�t simply go about messing with powers they don�t understand, you understand. And I�ve got a talent for holding people accountable.�\r      �Talent?� Frederick�s questioning made the demon pause. It glared menacingly at the mail carrier. Suddenly, without warning, Frederick�s frozen body sprung to life. It dropped to the ground, stiff like a pencil, Frederick prose in submission. If not for his nose, his lips could kiss the ground.\r      The demon, hunched over to look down on the mail carrier, lifted the cigarette to the middle of its face, and breathed deep. As it exhaled, the smoke merely melted into the cloud around its face. �I think a bit highly of myself, Frederick. Now, get up. You�re embarrassing yourself.� This command lifted Frederick�s lifeless body into the air. It returned to its pencil-straight, locked position.\r      �Don�t waste my time, Freddy.� Frederick could only agree. One more wrong word could kill him. He resolved to say as little as possible.\r      �I�m not evil�I realize this is all a bit much for you�but believe me, good people have no reason to fear me. Bad people, however, very much do. This city belongs to me. I make sure that when people, man, woman, or creature break the rules�� He drew on the cigarette and blew a puff of smoke in Frederick�s face. �Justice.�\r      �You�re the devil then?�\r      The demon chuckled. �The devil? That�s cute. He�s around.� He knocked his cane against the stone floor. The knock reverberated against the walls.\r      �So that�s what this is? A prison?�\r      �You don�t get any more questions.� The demon vanished in a puff of smoke. When it appeared again, it stood on the opposite end of the pool where the mirror once had stood. Where it had gone, Frederick did not know.\r      The demon spoke, his voice elevated to make up for the distance. �Do you like swimming, Freddy?�\r      One at a time, three bodies slowly surfaced in the water, faces up. They each floated still, parallel to each other. A man, a woman, and a child.\r      Frederick�s face betrayed him again, horrified at the sight. The demon responded to this with a laugh that filled the room.\r      �Don�t be afraid, good man! They aren�t dead. Just stuck, you see.� He walked to where he could reach the floating man with his cane. He pushed the body and it bobbed, stiff like wood. �This is Charles Garrison. You might have heard of him. Very rich, very nice guy.�\r      Frederick had indeed heard of him. Only recently, this man from the city had disappeared. The people of the city held him in high esteem for his large donations to local human rights organizations. �What did he do to deserve this?� Frederick cried, holding back groans of fear.\r      �Great man, really. Very generous. Did you know that he killed his first wife twenty-two years ago? No one knew because she died of a heart attack.�\r      �Then how was it his fault?�\r      �She was healthy as a horse, idiot! There�s more than one way to kill a person. You can do it by stabbing. You can do it by poison. Or you can do it by magic.�\r      The words stunned Frederick, mentally of course. He could not move. To think that Mr. Garrison had some sort of magical ability felt unbelievable. �He was a magician?�\r      �No, Freddy. He was rich. His lover dabbled in black magic. Some very dark stuff.� He lifted the cane into the air and pushed the man, Mr. Garrison, down into the water again. The body did not resurface.\r      �Who is the woman?� Frederick shouted.\r      �The lover!� It struck her body with a circular whip of his cane. She vanished in a puff of smoke.\r      Frederick looked at the body of the young girl, still floating, moving up and down in reaction to the movement of the water. �What about her? What was her sin?�\r      The demon would have been smiling had it a mouth. �She�s my niece. She�s quite nasty actually, little gremlin.� He knelt to look at her. �Freddy, I won�t tell you what she�s capable of. You don�t want to know.�\r      Frederick pondered this information. Now, he knew why the demon had brought him to this place. Something from his past had punched him in his mind. He had tried to forget, but the memory banged like a drum in sync with his heartbeat. He struggled to focus on the being. Come on! I can get out of this! \r      The being walked on the water of the pool as a solid floor. He bent over and pushed the girl down deep. Frederick tightened the muscles in his head, attempting to make something happen. For a moment, the ominous shadow flickered. Still, he remained. The demon walked slowly on the water, ever closer to Frederick.\r      �Ten years ago, something disturbed the waters of this pool. I came across a bottle floating upon it. Where did this come from? I wondered. How did a bottle find its way into the Pool of Souls? The note inside gave no answer to my thoughts. Merely a pact between two friends, Bullet and Steamy. Very childish nicknames.�\r      Frederick knew the names. When he heard them, his lip quivered.\r      �Familiar? I suspect so, Steamy.� The demon stared intently into Frederick�s eyes. The lights of its face seemed to be shining into the dark places of Frederick�s mind.\r      �Then, only a week or so more, a baseball. Then a candy wrapper. Then, yet again, a rose. All of these items, seemingly unrelated, appeared in my pool. Over the next year, the items became more and more complex. A TV, a toaster, a poster�even a pile of laundry! Littering my beautiful water. This must be some sort of accident. Perhaps the universe is playing a cruel joke on me. No one litters my pool. No one can access this water without my permission. It was impossible! But then, it happened.�\r      �What happened?� Frederick asked, but he already knew the answer.\r      �A cat appeared in the water. A grey cat. It lay lifeless, though I knew the truth. Then, I knew something was going wrong. Someone was intentionally sending things into my pool. That person was experimenting�growing their skill. Learning. Until they could do what no one in this life should be able to do.�\r      Frederick panicked. �I want to go! I want to leave!� he shouted.\r      �You cannot leave! You belong to me.� Growing in size, the demon laughed maniacally. Frederick�s mind flashed to the mirror. At first, he thought it showed a vision, but now he understood the truth.\r      �Who are you?� questioned Frederick, with tears in his eyes.\r      �My name is Saul. I am the first of my line, chosen to protect this dominion, that of both the living and the dead.� The dark figure drew moved closer as he spoke. The cloud of smoke around his head grew, shrouding the room in darkness. His voice echoed in the cold air.\r      �I am the King of Souls. I am their master. If you don�t bow in this life, you will bow in the next! I am your last hope. Don�t lie to me. Tell me what you did!�\r      \r      Darkness.\r      The devil comes to play at night.\r      He snatches those within his sight.",

        "text": "CHAPTER TWO\rThe Boy with Purple Sneakers\r      Barty Beauregard stuck out, even though he tried to blend in.\r      �Animals.� He said quietly. The other students on the bus yelled, cussed, swapped seats, and threw trash at each other. He clearly felt out of place among the other students, and they could see it. They acted their age, but Barty had the demeanor of a sixty year old man.\r      By thirteen, he had been through enough nonsense for one life. His dead mother had left him at the age of three. His father, wherever he had gone to these days, had to have Barty�s head examined when he started seeing ghosts. �Nonsense, boy,� the doctor told him. �It�s all in your head.�\r      �So is my brain,� replied Barty at ten years old. This did not amuse the man. Other kids picked on him. His relatives told him to be quiet. Dr. Wilson told him that �a strong delusion has taken hold of you,� Barty was done with nonsense.\r      �Is this seat taken?� A large, pimply boy with red curly hair asked, indicating the empty place next to Barty.\r      �Yes,� Barty responded coldly, knowing the question had been rhetorical.\r      The boy, heavily confused, glanced at the empty seat and back at Barty. Barty caught his eye with a stare that could scare a prosecutor. Don�t you dare.\r      The boy moved on.\r      Barty did not intend to be mean or aloof. He just preferred people at a distance.\r      �Thirty-two days and counting�� He scribbled a note in his notepad. \r      He had not spoken face to face with his father, Andrew Beauregard, for thirty-two days. Mr. Beauregard audited business books for a living. �It�s a bit like detective work,� he explained. Barty understood this to mean �incredibly dull.� Before departing, Mr. Beauregard promised the boy, �I�ll be back soon, Barty.� But after a while, when the calls stopped, Barty suspected the worst. Famous last words.\r      So, it pleased him when a girl met him in the Hell Hall, an abandoned corridor at Mont Linola Junior High, and asked him to help with a simple task: get Beau Adams expelled. This could provide a perfect distraction while he waited for his father to return.\r      �He hurt my brother,� she cried. And Barty believed it.\r      If you looked up �terrifying� in the dictionary, Beau�s baby picture would be listed. At fifteen, Beau towered over the other kids. Held back the year before, he had a temper as hot as a cast iron handle. He threw kids off their skateboards for sport. Legend had it, he cornered a boy, held him down, and pushed a pin into his shoulder. Then, he played a part in the school play�as the Great Wall of China.\r      Barty knew he could do something about this. Actually, he would let Beau do the work himself. If Beau got into a bad enough fight, it would certainly spell expulsion. He had already secured probation by locking a seventh-grader in a locker for a day. When the janitor found the boy, he had soiled pants and a smell that would last a week.\r      Yes, Barty knew that he could do the job. He had already outwitted quite a few foes in his short life. But for his plan to work, he needed someone to be the bait. Fortunately, he knew the perfect fool for the job.\r      Preston Farrell, a fourteen year old, made girls squirm. The first time he managed to kiss one, he told everybody she begged for it. After enough guys had harassed her, she produced a damaging recording: Preston hounding, nearly cornering, her for a kiss. The school quickly changed sides. There would be no sympathy if Preston got squished�the school would welcome it.\r   �Step one: start a rumor about Preston.� He smiled and marked the list he had started weeks prior. �Check.� \r   At a school like Mont Linola Junior High, words spread like the flu. Kids traded gossip like trading cards. �The fortune teller, Mad Addy, had it out for him. She�s the one that did it, my mom said.�\r   �Oh yeah? Well, if you need test answers, ask the new girl. She can get anything.� All of this, Barty suspected, was nonsense. Gluttony for gullibility made the perfect foundation for Barty�s scheme.\r    A few bathroom conversations, slipped notes, and message board threads had sealed Preston�s fate. He had six months to live. Even the teachers began to whisper when Preston came around. Of course, Preston denied it�until the special favors began. Kids let him cut in line. They gave him their unwanted desserts, and some bought him tickets to see the latest superhero flick. His tune started to change. �Yeah� I have so little left. I just hope the doctors can figure something out.� Yeah, Preston. Barty thought. I hope so, too.\r      Next, Barty spread the net to Kelly Prescott. She adored mocking him, and her four groupies made a great crowd. Barty suspected she paid them well to act like seals, always clapping and laughing.\r      �Barty Beauregard,� she once began. �You look so handsome in your perfect school uniform. Did mommy iron it this morning?�\r      The Preppy Pinks laughed. �Oh, good one!�\r      �My mom died when I was three,� he stated. �I iron my own clothes.�\r      �Aw, little Barty doesn�t have a mommy to iron his clothes,� she mocked.\r      Once again, the girls cheered stupidly. �Wow! No mom? What a loser!� Kelly loved attention. And he would make sure she got it.\r      Barty mused, thinking back to the day he managed to rope her in, picturing his vantage point.\r      �Why? Why would I do that?� Preston Farrell questioned, hands still holding his spaghetti noodles by the fork. Barty spied the conversation from two seats away, pretending to be writing in his notebook.\r      �Because she wants you. Everybody knows, too.�\r      Barty could hardly hear through the sound of chairs sliding on linoleum and kids exchanging jokes. But amongst the chaos, he knew better than to let his guard up. Never too careful, Barty, he had thought. He surveyed the cafeteria, accidentally meeting eyes with the new girl across the room. She quickly turned away. \r      �Who knows? Who says that?� Preston prodded, curiosity growing. Barty�s mind lingered on the smell of wheat rolls drifting through the cafeteria. Ugh�\r      A tray crashing against the table snapped him back into attention.\r      �She told her friends, �I want Preston Farrell to take me to the End of School Dance.� And I heard it from some dude in chemistry.�\r      Layers of separation, Barty said to himself. Never too close.\r      Preston looked like he had swallowed wrong. His spaghetti had begun to look more like stomach contents. He had minced his bread roll with his bare fingers.\r      �She wants me, you think?� He rubbed his chin, considering the proposition.\r      Barty�s eyebrows rose. Take the bait.\r      The nameless boy continued, �If I were you, I�d make my move soon. You know. And I know. Kelly won�t be single for long. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.�\r      Barty glanced up at an adult watching them from across the room. He took a mental picture of the man, his wild grin and loud voice, annoying the teachers with whom he spoke. Too much attention, he thought, turning his thoughts back to his table. \r      Preston�s cheeks lifted into a silly grin. He clasped his hands behind his head and reclined his chair. �She wants me. Kelly Prescott. I really thought she might. Would hate to disappoint her.�\r      From his pocket, Preston supplied a pack of WinterEsque mints. �Always ready,� as his catchphrase went. He did this a lot. Preston had no clue his breath mints smelled like bad news. He strode confidently from one side of the cafeteria toward No Man�s Land for losers: the popular table. His shoes, purple basketball sneakers, clashed with his school uniform�just the way he liked them. The whole school noticed.\r      Barty heard the girls behind him whisper, �what is he doing? Preston Farrell� He looks like he�s going to talk to Kelly�� Oh, but he was. Exactly as Barty planned. He had money involved in that interaction. Taking the dying boy to the dance, she would become the ultimate attention queen. \r      Every eye turned to watch the exchange. Barty took this opportunity to slip a five-dollar bill under the food tray on the table. Then, he exited, sure of his success.\r\r      Barty jerked to the side as the bus ripped around a corner. His hand slipped on the page, leaving a long line of ink. He wrote a few more lines but eventually tore it out. He crumpled the paper into a ball. �Should have used a pencil,� he remarked to himself.\r      The boy from earlier leaned into Barty�s personal space, over his shoulder. �Did you hear? Preston Farrell asked Kelly Prescott to the dance.� He spoke through a mouth full of breakfast.\r      �Oh yeah? Did he?� Barty pulled back. \r      �Yeah. I can�t wait to see what happens when Beau finds out. They�re still talking, aren�t they?�\r      Barty felt his mouth turn up into a small smile. �Yes, they are.�\r      �Beau�s going to destroy him,� the boy said.\r      �God, I hope so.� The words fell out of Barty�s mouth, too soon to stop.\r      �What? What do you mean?� \r      Barty summoned a quick cover up. �I said �probably so.��\r      �Oh! I thought you were happy for a second.�\r      Barty indeed felt happy. Everything had gone according to plan. But if the school thought he enjoyed the physical assault of Preston Farrell, things could get messy. If the faculty found out he had orchestrated a fight between two boys, what would they do? Could he be expelled himself? \r      He pictured the man watching him in the cafeteria. And what about the new girl? Students gossiped about her uncanny ability to get information. Could she be a snare in his plan? She had watched him in the cafeteria. Probably just a fluke, he assured himself.\r      The school bus came to a stop, and the students scrambled. They twisted and shoved each other, competing to exit. Barty sat, waiting. Once the last students left, he gathered his things. As he neared the exit, the driver eyed him in the mirror.\r      �Any news, Barty?�\r      �Not yet. I�ll ask tonight.�\r      The driver frowned. �It won�t be long. I�m sure you�ll know more soon.�\r      Barty hoped so, but he did not say any more.\r      \r      As Barty made his way to the entrance, students hustled to exchange last minute news updates before starting their studies. �Beau is going to kill him!� said a girl in a green jacket.\r      �I heard Preston has two weeks to live,� said a boy with blonde hair that stood straight up. �She only said yes because she knows he�ll be dead anyway.� \r      A couple of twin girls held hands and walked past Barty to the cafeteria. He overheard them musing, �what are you wearing to the dance?�\r      �I�m wearing blue sequins and a glittery hair bow and a long baby blue scarf.�\r      �Gross!� The other laughed. �Me too!�\r      The school buzzed about the soon-coming summer break and end of term dance. Posters adorned the walls with the dance�s theme, Gettin� Outta Here. One of the students had illustrated the posters with a red convertible. Driving the convertible, a student that looked like a character from a sixties� high school flick gave a peace sign with his fingers. In the passenger seat, a girl in a floral dress held her hat from flying off as they drove into the sunset. The drama department had even constructed a life size paper-m�ch� vehicle that students took photos with.\r      Not for an instant had Barty considered going to the dance himself. He preferred the solitude of life-giving activities, such as building plastic brick figures or collecting Monster Runner cards. He had no time for school functions or after school activities. \r      His eyes focused on the poster. What an odd detail, Barty thought. In the background of the illustrated sheet, he noticed someone had drawn little ghost-like spirits circling the Sun. From a distance, it looked like a sunny haze.\r      Then, out of nowhere, a voice called, �Sup!� Barty jumped.\r      Her bleach blonde bangs covered her eyebrows. The way her voice sounded, bright and friendly, did not match her general aesthetic, dark lined makeup and bat earrings.\r      Barty glared at her for a moment, then awkwardly returned his eyes to the poster. Leave me alone. \r      �What do you think of the poster?� She examined the poster herself. Barty changed his face purposefully to evoke interest without speaking. She continued. �Do you like it? Do you talk?�\r      �Yes,� Barty spoke before moving on, leaving the girl behind. What an odd individual, he thought.\r      Throughout school periods, Barty listened for news of Beau�s retaliatory plans. He asked around at lunch and took bets on who would win the fight. Only during his seventh period gym class did he hear word on the next part of his scheme.\r      Coach Grant, a thin balding man in his twenties, gave instructions on the warmup routines. He looked out of sorts as a gym teacher, looking more like a former glee kid. The students groaned as he barked out orders in his high voice. �I don�t want to hear it! If you can�t do a few push-ups, how are you gonna handle working a nine-to-five for twenty years?�\r      One particularly clownish student remarked, �by sitting on our butts.� The class laughed, sparking Coach Grant�s dictatorial tendencies.\r      He whistled loudly and barked, �Five laps from everybody! Let�s go!� This drew continued cries from the students.\r      Barty trailed behind in the slow group. Several boys sprinted immediately, competing against an imaginary group of runners. As they lapped the walkers, they would yell �watch out!� or �slow traffic move right!� Barty thought extraordinarily little of show-offs.\r      Instead, he found himself fast-walking behind a couple of girls and a boy that looked like he did not get out much at all. The three joked about running and made comments about how much they wanted to nap. Then one of the girls remarked, �Yeah, so Beau is really mad about the whole Kelly situation.�\r      Barty�s ears perked up. �What Kelly situation?�\r      The other girl, Corey, chimed in. �Barty, you were there. I saw you. You know about what I�m talking about.� Barty flushed. People did pay attention at times, an uncomfortable reminder.\r      �In the cafeteria?� He tried to play it off.\r      �Yes, of course. With Preston.� The first girl, Nelly, continued through shallow breaths. �Well, I heard he called Kelly and they had a huge fight. I don�t know if they�re gonna keep talking.�\r      The boy cut in, �So she�s free then? Maybe I�ll��\r      �NO!� said the two girls.\r      �Oh, c�mon, guys,� he replied, laughing to himself. �That�s mean.�\r      Corey came to his defense, �Jackson, you�re too good for Kelly. It�s not a dig on you, trust us. She has major daddy issues.�\r      The first girl continued, �But Beau�s fuming. Someone overheard him yesterday in the bathroom crying. He was saying some pretty scary stuff.� Barty walked faster to catch up, suddenly very interested. He did not know Beau had feelings. \r      �What kind of stuff?� Barty asked.\r      �Violent. He might hurt Preston.�\r      Barty wanted to feel good about this news, but part of him felt bad about Beau�s crying. It made the monster seem human.\r      �Who�s that?� Jackson asked, looking at a runner in front of them. �She�s kind of cute from this angle.�\r      �Jackson!� Both of the girls reprimanded him.\r      Barty recognized the light blonde hair immediately, but now he saw thick black and white striped socks that she wore. They rose to the middle of her calves, oddly long for a sweltering summer day.\r      �You don�t want that,� Corey said. �I�ve heard weird things about her.�\r      �Be nice,� Michelle replied.\r      �I�m not being mean. I just heard she�s just� odd. Talks to herself a lot. She disappears at lunch sometimes, and no one knows where. Probably a witch. I heard the inside of her locker�s covered with dead bones.�\r      �Sounds like a normal girl,� Barty interjected. He did not want to admit that he too felt uneasy about her. \r      �Where did she come from?� Jackson asked.\r      �I think she�s a foster kid or something,� said Corey.\r      �I wonder if she has a date to the dance yet,� said Jackson. �Maybe, I�ll go get to know her.�\r      Barty thought the girl looked like she moonlighted as a crypt keeper. He suspected that Jackson would not interest her. His favorite interests included farts and the latest news in the world of fishing.\r      Barty could not help but prod him on. �Maybe you should. You�re probably just her type.�\r      In the locker room after P.E., Barty showered in a private stall. He relaxed after rinsing the sunscreen and sweat away. His clothes had begun sticking to his skin, so he had nearly raced to wash. Outside, the other boys whipped their towels and made lewd comments about the girls they would like to date. Barty had no interest in being friends with any of the other boys in his grade. Usually, he found them gross at best and Preston-ly at worst. He had tried tuning out their loud grunts and jeers.\r      But then, Barty heard the words he had been longing to hear. �Beau�s doing it today.�\r      �What? Doing what?� another boy asked, sounding desperate.\r      �Preston. He�s confronting him, and he�s super mad.�\r      �What�s he gonna do?�\r      �He�s gonna kill him, I think.� The boy solemnly spoke. �Or hurt him bad.�\r      Barty�s ears burned. Wherever this happened, he needed to be there.\r      �Oh, dang.� The second boy chuckled. �I�ve got to see it. I put twenty dollars on Beau.�\r      �Yeah, me too. I don�t know who would bet on Preston. Guys a fish. Sure, he can swim, but he�s got no meat.�\r      Barty did not care about this banter. He craved details. He deepened his voice and called out. �Where is this supposed to happen?�\r      The first boy responded, �uh, it�s happening right after school. I think somewhere close to the bus line.�\r      �Thanks.� Barty quickly finished, grabbed his things, and left. Checking his watch, he began walking faster. He brushed his hair with his hand, but it mattered little. He had medium length curly dark hair that only a few specialty products could tame.\r      He began down the Hell Hall. Most students believed a body had been found there and avoided the pathway. Barty believed this a myth. Still, He would not jeopardize a good shortcut by fact-checking urban legends.\r      He walked half the hall's length when a voice called out after him. �You�re a little stupid, huh?�\r      Barty stopped, dead in his tracks. He had hoped to meet someone here. He left bait, after all. He shot around and saw the new girl, dry and clean, as if she had not just been running. \r      Surprise, surprise. �I don�t know what you mean,� he replied coolly.\r      She walked toward him, grinning. The faculty left the light off in this hallway. Only the red exit sign glowed in the dark. Her hair, illuminated by the light, almost resembled a devilish halo.\r      �I know about Laurie. And Kelly. And Preston. And Beau,� she teased. �You�re sneaky. But you should be more careful.�\r      Barty stood blank faced. He felt certain that he alone knew all of the details. He had not even told Laurie the whole plan. But here she stood, claiming to know everything. Barty knew better than to confess. �Ok, genius. Tell me what you know.�\r      She walked ever closer, one foot in front of the other. She carried the air of someone with power. From her pocket, she produced a single crumpled-up piece of paper. She tossed it with impeccable aim and hit Barty squarely on the forehead.\r      �You�re orchestrating Beau Adam�s demise. You started the rumor that Preston had cancer or something, because you knew Kelly would say yes when he asked her to the dance. You knew Beau couldn�t stand that. You�re planning on them getting into it and Beau annihilating Preston.�\r      He bent over and lifted the piece of paper, unfolding it as he rose. He recognized the sheet from his own notebook. Then, reading it, his lips revealed a sly grin.\r      �What�s so funny?� she asked.\r      �I thought someone might be following me.�\r      She folded her arms in disapproval. �Maybe you were right. That paper says an awful lot. Could get you in trouble.�\r      �Could it? I don�t think so.� He started walking backwards. �A few notes. Enough to make someone think I�d be here, now. Not much else, though. Where did you get the rest?�\r      �Cute trick,� She smirked. �I�m just smart.�\r      �I dropped this on the bus, but I�ve never seen you on it. I don�t know how you know everything you know, but you do.�\r      Barty backed away faster now. �I like my privacy. Tell Laurie you don�t have to follow me. I know what I�m doing. I�m not going to get caught.�\r      She tapped her foot on the ground. �You�re not perfect, Barty. I could help.�\r      Barty turned and walked away from her. �I�m not perfect, but I�m good. You know that.� He smiled to himself. �Since you�re so interested in me.�\r      With that, he exited the hall, moving toward the school exit. He ran, slowing down when he saw teachers. They expected it, but still barked �no, sir!� when he passed.\r      �Sorry!� He would call back. He did not mean it.\r      When finally he came to the hallway leading to the bus rider line, students had begun gathering to leave. Teachers called instructions and corrected behavior, but the bustling teenagers had mostly little supervision. Barty first looked for the purple shoes, but did not see them. He pushed through to the front, but still he found no luck.\r      He exited the crowd, glad to create distance from the students, and stared at the exit sign. Where are they? Usually, school fights broke out in the middle of the hall. Students rarely put thought into the when and where.\r      Someone tapped on his shoulder. �Barty!� He whipped around and met eyes with the girl he left in the Hell Hall.\r      �What?� He whispered harshly.\r      �They�re in the B wing restroom.�\r      Barty did not have a reason to take her word for it. For all he knew, she could lead him straight into trouble. But still, something about the way she spoke sounded sincere. Barty prided himself on his knack for detecting deception. �Okay. Let�s go.�\r      Off they went, as fast as they could with teachers prowling the halls, gathering last minute homework assignments for grading. �Where are you two going?� Called the school administrator, a large woman in a purple dress. She wore bright red lipstick and gold earrings.\r      �We have a group report for Miss Fauxian,� said the girl. �She said we had to get it to her by the end of today.�\r      �A report?� Her eyebrows, chiseled by eyeliner, raised to meet her hairline. �At this time of day? I don�t see paper.�\r      �It�s a PDF. Mr. Davis told us to bring it,� the girl lied again. �It�s on my phone. He has to help me upload it to his email.�\r      The woman thought for a moment, her face contorting. �Better get goin�. And don�t let me hear y�all been sneaking off to some corner somewhere, understand? It�ll be detention for the both of you.�\r      They nodded their agreement. The girl snuck a glance at Barty. They would not let her hear of anything they intended to do at all.\r      When they reached the restroom, they heard voices drifting from the tiled entrance to the restrooms.\r      �That�s Beau Adams,� the girl said. \r      �I know,� said Barty. �I�ve got to get in there. I�ve got to record it.� He rose to move closer, but the girl yanked him back by his backpack.\r      She made a face at him. �You really are crazy! You want to get killed?�\r      �I�m not an idiot.� His head flooded with indignation. �I�ll be discreet.�\r      �What if we drew them out instead?� She offered.\r      Barty contemplated the ways that they might make this happen. �Go on.�\r      �Hide behind this doorway,� she indicated to the entranceway to the main auditorium. The doors were set back, providing a corner to hide in. Barty complied.\r      She ran down the hall, her feet barely grazing the floor. Then, cupping her mouth with her hands, she bellowed, �Hey, I�m coming! I just gotta do one last bathroom check!� Barty detected a Jersey accent.\r      Then she deepened her voice. �Great, but check the stairways first!�\r      Barty heard fast footsteps from the restroom, accompanied by muffled voices. Then, he heard Beau Adam�s dragging Preston Farrel out of the restroom. Another boy, most likely a minion of Beau�s, followed closely behind. They stormed out the exit.\r      When Barty emerged from his hiding spot, he caught a glimpse of their figures vanishing down the lawn to the football field. \r      �They�ll go under the bleachers.� Barty remarked.\r      �Let�s go,� said the girl, suddenly at his side. \r      The pair sprang through the doors, resembling spies, ducking and dodging invisible foes. Then, in the distance, they saw Beau and the other boy looking down on Preston.\r      They peered from around the concession stand, giving them a perfect vantage point to record the action. Barty saw Preston on his knees. Beau paced back and forth, looking stressed. �Do it. Get it over with!� He seemed to be speaking to himself.\r      �Come on, Beau,� Preston whispered defiantly. �Don�t be scared.� Barty thought these words odd for someone in danger of being turned into mashed weasel. �She�s probably watching us right now.� Barty could hear the words, although they had clearly been trying to speak in hushed tones. Barty pulled out his phone to record. Holding it up, he tried to press the button, but his camera froze. He assaulted the screen with his thumb, hoping to make something happen.\r      �Come on,� he spoke to it gently. �Record.� \r      �What�s wrong?� The nameless girl asked. \r      �I can�t get the camera to work. I don�t know what�s wrong.� He put it away, giving up. �Can you use your phone?�\r      �I don�t have a phone,� she said.\r      Barty looked at her in shock. �I guess we�re witnesses then.� \r      Beau spoke again. �What if it doesn�t work? What if someone�� He looked around him, pausing to think. �What if, you know, someone else sees.�\r      �Be quiet!� Preston commanded. Then, he looked around for witnesses. �I mean� Please don�t, Beau! We�re in love!�\r      It seemed to Barty that Preston had to be faking. But why, he did not know. He looked at the girl. �What are they talking about?� She stared down, her eyes darting back and forth. She seemed to be scheming.\r      The third boy that had not spoken until now chimed in. �Beau, get it over with. We can try again later if� you know.�\r      Beau stopped his pacing and looked at Preston dead on. Preston nodded approval. Then, the oversized giant of a boy reached into his pocket and pulled out a blade that shimmered in the midday sun, peaking through the lined shadows of the bleachers.\r      Barty felt a surge of adrenaline. His eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. The girl grabbed his wrist and squeezed. �What is going on? Is he going to stab Preston?� Barty did not know.\r      Beau edged toward Preston slowly. Preston eyed him with a sinister grin. �Don�t touch me, fatty!� He projected these words high into the air. Beau reached down and grabbed him by the hair. He thrust Preston�s head back, revealing his Adam�s apple. Then, he yelled as loud as he could, �SHE. WAS. MINE!� The words echoed throughout the stands. �YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER ALONE!� He put the knife to Preston�s neck.\r      Time stood still momentarily. Barty considered the implications of such an act. He did not intend for Beau to take things this far. Could the boy really murder someone over a Junior High crush? Barty could not know for certain. He had not yet had such strong feelings for someone. But in that moment, he felt a powerful urge within him that opened his mouth.\r      �NO! DON�T!� Barty screamed.\r      All three of the boys looked at him.\r      �Oh�� Beau swore. �It�s not her!�\r      Preston met eyes with Barty and barked, �Grab him!�\r      Barty reached to pull the girl and run, but she had gone. He panicked, now alone, and turned to flee. At first, he aimed for the doors of the school, but the third, nameless boy had already cut him off. He made a sharp turn and ran through the passage between the bleachers. He knew, if he ran to the field, his chances were slim that he could catch someone�s attention. But he recalled often watching from the doors of the school. From there, one could see the students that sat on the top section of the bleachers. Perhaps, he could draw attention from there.\r      Barty might have been small, but he could move. He climbed the bleachers with incredible speed, leaving the three boys behind. Once at the uppermost level, he waved his hands erratically. His eyes searched the doors of the school, hoping to see someone�anyone. \r      �You�ve got nowhere to run, Barty.� Preston stepped, one by one, over the bleachers to Barty�s location. Preston seemed like the ringleader in this band of conspirators. The two others stood on opposite sides, guarding Barty�s ways of escape. They had him boxed in.\r      �We don�t want to hurt you, Barty.� Preston said. For some reason, Barty doubted this very much.\r      Beau shouted, �What if he tells someone? You said no one would see!�\r      �Shut up, Beau!� Preston shouted.\r      �Tell what?� Barty asked. �What�s going on here?� Barty felt stupid asking this question. After all, he had originally intended for Preston to take the hit. But being killed? Not at all.\r      �Barty, you�re not going to say a damn thing to anyone about what you saw.� He looked at Beau, still holding the knife. Beau seemed to be hyperventilating, holding his head in his hands.\r      �Give me the knife,� Preston urged. Beau did not respond. He just stared back and forth between Barty and Preston, arguing in his own mind. Barty knew that Beau�s brain had similar qualities to a bunch of dynamite. Sooner or later, it would demolish something. Barty had planned on this, but he had not planned on being part of the demolition.\r      �Just give it to me!� Preston walked over and tried to snatch the knife away from the boy, helpless to move. �He�s just another idiot! We don�t have to hurt him too bad.�\r      �He knows too much!� Beau yelled, desperately. �I�ll be expelled!�\r      Barty�s heart raced. What had he gotten himself into? Originally he felt in control. Now, the tables had turned in his direction.\r      �Tough luck, Preston.� The voice of Barty�s mystery accomplice drifted clearly in the wind. But, from where, Barty and indeed the others, could not see. They each hunted for the source, turning in circles. �She�s here!� said Preston.\r      �Show yourself, Mildred.� Beau replied. �You can�t hide forever!�\r      \r      �Leave her alone, Preston.� Barty did not know her hiding place, but he could at least distract the boys. �She�s just another girl that thinks you�re a creep.�\r      Red faced, Preston turned back to Barty. �Shut up, Barty.� He advanced further. �Your mom�s dead. Your dad is dead. I guess you wanna die, too.� Barty�s mouth hung open. Preston must have lost his mind.\r      �My dad�s not dead, moron!�\r      �We all thought it was weird to see you acting so normal. But I get it now, Barty. You�re just delusional!�\r      Beau started moving again, this time faster. Barty backed up against the fence but had nowhere to go. He could not move through the fence guard, and climbing over provided no escape. The top level of the stands brought the viewers a good thirty feet off the ground. A fall would secure his death.\r      Beau lunged over the benches and grabbed Barty by the collar, the knife blade brushing Barty�s cheek. He lifted him into the air, pushing his back into the fencing stopping them from toppling over the edge. Preston walked to the side of the two, looking flustered. �Beau! Don�t do this. It�s not worth it.�\r      �I�m not gonna kill him. I�m just gonna make him bleed.� Beau�s temper had reached its limit. He whispered in Barty�s ear, �think your girlfriend�s gonna come out? I�ve had enough of her.� His cheeks had turned a violent shade of red, and his breath reeked of cigarette smoke.\r      Barty did not believe that Beau could murder someone. However, he did believe he could accidentally send Barty over the fencing.\r      �I guess,� Barty nearly choked, trying to breathe through Beau�s grip on his shirt. �I guess it�s too late to be friends.�\r      Beau spit in Barty�s face. The struggling captive could feel the saliva on the tip of his lip. He clinched his lips, attempting to block the liquid from entering his mouth. \r      Beau grinned an evil, toothy smile, wheezing with every breath. He suspended Barty against the fence with one arm, the other hand moving the knife to Barty�s ear. �I know how to make sure you never stick your ears in someone else�s business ever again!� He looked over his shoulder and shouted. �Mildred, you better come out of your hiding spot or I�m gonna give your buddy a hole in his head!�\r      �Don�t touch him, you empty brainbox!� Her voice came from somewhere that none could find.\r      Beau pressed the blade into Barty�s earlobe, using his thumb on the backside. Barty felt searing, sharp pain as the hot metal made its slice. He cried out in loud moans, still trying to keep his mouth closed. Blood trickled down his neck.\r      �I�m gonna send you down these steps, fart-face!� Mildred�s insult did little to stop Beau from continuing his torture. He pulled the knife down, the blade separating his skin with stinging pain. Barty opened his mouth now and screamed as loud as he could. \r      �You enjoy that?� Beau muttered. �Scream all you want.�\r      Barty saw a flash in his mind of a boy getting his shoulder stabbed by Beau. Now, he realized that he would become the new story. He would be the next victim of Beau�s vindictive temperament. He cut off Barty�s ear�\r      He prepared himself for what came next and, with a surge of power, kicked Beau between the legs.\r      Too stunned to speak, too stunned to even react, Beau released Barty and collapsed. Barty heard the knife slide, clack, clack as it fell below the bleachers to the grass below.\r      Barty dashed, desperately searching for a way out. Preston also moved, rushing to prevent his escape. He made it a few steps, nearly falling over the bleachers when Preston grabbed him hard by the arm. �Oh, no. You�re not going anywhere!� he said. Beau had almost recovered and began walking in their direction. The other boy grabbed Barty�s remaining arm, making Barty helpless to move.\r      Beau approached, more incensed than ever. �I�m really gonna screw you up!� Barty squirmed, Beau�s enormous head growing in size. The boy pulled his arm back, forming a fist the size of a soccer ball.\r      �You�re too late, boys.� came the calm voice of Mildred, like a siren on the sea. She sounded closer than any of them to Barty. But still, she could not be seen. Barty wondered if she hung below the bleachers somehow.\r      Cries echoed faintly in the distance as three small figures appeared at the bottom of the field. Each of the bullies and Barty stopped to look.\r      THUD! Beau fell over the bench behind his calves and toppled down the stands. The mystery girl, that Barty surmised had been named Mildred, stood triumphantly over Beau�s falled body. Beau rubbed his cheek, red with a fist mark. Blood trickled down his nose as he pointed up at her.\r      �Y-y-you! How did you��\r      �Yes, butthead?� She looked like a teacher scolding a toddler.\r      �You�re not normal!� Preston yelled. \r      �Duh,� she replied.\r      The sound of feet climbing the bleacher steps snapped them out of their admiration. The woman in purple, the school officer, and the Principal each climbed.\r      �Take that boy into custody, officer,� said Mr. Green, the principal. �And you two,� he indicated to the other two boys. �Don�t move another inch. You�re done.�\r      \r      After the fight on the bleachers, the woman in purple, the school administrator, called Barty�s caretaker (he did not like the word nanny), Sarah Badeoux. Originally, Sarah had been a work acquaintance of Barty�s father. Barty thought she must have been in her early fifties, but he dared not ask. He knew better. She would stay the night with Barty when his dad went on business, making sure he had food and that he got to and from school safely.\r      When the principal called, she drove in person to retrieve Barty. She drove a fancy, old car. It looked like something a funeral home director might drive, with wide, white leather seats and all the amenities. \r      During a lengthy discussion in Principal Green�s office, Barty and Mildred sat in the admin office waiting. Mildred�s guardian had not come. Barty thought this odd. But he reasoned that perhaps foster parents could not come at the drop of a hat. After all, Sarah worked for his father. For whom did foster parents work?\r      �Are you okay?� Mildred asked, two seats away from Barty.\r      �Yes,� he replied. His right knee had been shaking up and down. his hands folded in his lap.\r      She blankly stared at him, her eyes studied his body language, attempting to read his face. �If you�re worried about getting in trouble, I won�t say anything.� Barty breathed deeply. He doubted the administration could link the events to him, regardless of what Beau and Preston and the third boy said. If anything, they would eye Mildred. But hearing her say this made him calmer. In a way, it felt like an olive branch, an �I�m on your side.�\r      Mr. Green assured that the situation would be handled. �Mont Linola is no place for criminal children!� Barty squirmed at this comment. �We remain a safe place to send your kids! We always have been, and we always will be. I assure you, madame.� But no matter how much he insisted otherwise, the police had been called. In fact, the school began to look like a crime scene, with police cars and ambulances. Officers questioned Barty and Mildred, as well as the others. EMT�s did health checks on all the kids involved and asked if they needed to go to the emergency room.\r      �I think we will be alright, thank you,� said Sarah.\r      Barty rubbed the butterfly stitches holding his ear together. The incident had gone further than he intended, and he still did not know why. He knew the following Monday, the whole school would know what happened. Even the evening news had run a story on the fight.\r      �A child murderer? Or a hurting soul.� A man in a blue suit leaned into a zooming camera. �Things got dicey when a school love affair turned deadly.� The story cut to a video of Kelly Prescott, eyes watering.\r      �I never meant for anyone to get hurt.� She dabbed her eyes with a pink handkerchief. �When�BLEEP�asked me to the dance, I knew I had to say yes. He�s dying after all!� The news station had bleeped out Preston�s name.\r      The reporter in blue appeared on the screen again, interviewing her. �Dying? That�s a whole new layer to this situation. This other boy�BLEEP�sounds like he�d kill for the chance to dance.�\r      Kelly nodded. �You never know a guy. Who knew he was clinically insane!�\r      �How does this third boy fit into the picture?�\r      �Barty?� Kelly clarified.\r      Barty�s face burned when he heard his name on television. Why not protect his identity as well?\r      �He told�BLEEP�that he was in love with me,� she continued.\r      Barty yelled at the tv screen, �I said WHAT?!�\r      �He was in love with you.� The reporter cut in. �A love-parallelogram.� \r      �It was more like a love circle, really. I never dreamed about going out with Barty Beauregard!�\r      Barty felt anger welling up inside when she said this. �Who said I wanted to go with you at all?� he said aloud.\r      The image cut to coach Grant, who appeared to be speaking on behalf of the school. He stood on the football field, talking into a microphone.\r      �It was my quick response that saved the day,� he leaned forward, peering at an imaginary foe. �Always watching. I never let my guard down. You never know when something might happen. When I saw what was going on up there, I immediately sent help.�\r      The journalist appeared on the screen again, behind a studio desk. �We spoke to Principal Green. He stated, �Mont Linola Junior High remains a stronghold of education. Your children will never be harmed in our care, we assure you.��\r      Sarah turned off the tv.\r      �Oh, my goodness.� Sighing, she sat down on the red couch Barty�s father had bought the previous summer. It still smelled new. �What a day, right?�\r      She offered him a bowl of ice cream, which he gratefully accepted.\r      �Sarah,� he said between bites of cookie dough. �Can I ask you something weird?�\r      She narrowed her eyes at him, trying to figure out the question before he asked.\r      �How weird?� Barty recognized this as an attempt to lighten the mood. He would not play along.\r      �Preston said something that bothered me. He said that my dad was�� He thought for a moment about what to say. �He said he was dead.�\r      Sarah continued eating her ice cream, looking at the television. Barty waited for a response, but she seemed locked into an imaginary program.\r      �Sarah? Did you hear me?� He surveyed her frozen face. Nothing seemed to be happening behind her eyes. Barty felt odd about this. \r      Then, she snapped back to life, like she had been processing the question. �What?�\r      Barty, startled, wondered what had been going on in her mind during that moment. Maybe she thought it, too.\r      �Yeah,� Barty tried to continue casually. �He said everyone thought I was in denial or something. Like I was delusional.�\r      �Sounds like he�s the delusional one.� She took another bite of ice cream. �That boy needs serious help. Stay away from him.�\r      After showering and changing into his striped pajamas, he brushed his teeth. Then, he laid out his clothes for the following day, ironing and lint rolling. Before sliding into his sheets, he made a checklist in his journal for the following day. His ritual ended another day without his father.\r      He listened to the quiet chirping of crickets outside the window. Orange light from a streetlamp dimly glowed through the blinds of his room. Sometimes, he felt afraid at night. He remembered that as a younger child, he feared a stranger breaking in and hurting him. But now anymore. Now, he felt afraid of scarier things. And these, he knew, could happen again. He had already lost one parent.\r      In the stillness of the room, he heard a familiar noise, the low rhythm of a train chugging along in the distance. Barty imagined that if it had been any closer, the house might have shaken. In the winter, sometimes the chugging noise grew so loud, he could hardly sleep. It encompassed the room, filling the air with energetic thrums.\r      He closed his eyes, trying to ignore it, like the people he sometimes saw. And just like the figures that talked to him when he met their eyes, this train did not exist.",

        "text": "CHAPTER THREE\rThe Lady in Blue\r      Twenty-five days before Beau cut Barty in the ear, Stan and Loyd Webster, attorneys for his dad�s work, walked through the front door of his house in historic Mont Linola. He understood historic to mean �old.� The house looked like a cottage, with thick wooden plank siding and a small front porch. On their quiet street, their large red convertible stuck out like a pimple, ready to pop.\r      When Sarah opened the door for them, their footsteps resonated on the raised floor. He could hear them enter all the way in his back bedroom. \r      �Barty, we don�t know how to tell you this,� Frank had said. He sat at their table in the dining room.\r      �Your dad�s missing,� Loyd finished, still standing, ready to leave. Apparently, they did know how to say it. Barty hoped he would never have to see them again, wearing their matching grey suits and big red glasses. They told him that the company would continue to pay Sarah for the time being.\r      Barty�s dad may have gone missing, but could he really be dead? At the very least, Barty hoped not. What would he do if both of his parents died?\r      The Saturday morning after the fight on the bleachers, when he woke, the day welcomed him with glorious, glowing light that filtered through the leaves of his shaded street. After a good rain, the vegetation seemed to glow with life. The greens almost looked blue, and the air felt cool and clear. He could hear birds chirping, beckoning him to come out and play. After eating a bowl of cinnamon and sugar cereal, he changed into the clothes that he had prepared and ran out the back door.\r      He carefully stepped on landscape stones that led to the back corner of his yard. If he missed, he knew his feet would step into the grass and sink into the mud, filling his shoes with moisture. He prayed to avoid this.\r      Then, when he reached the double doors of the white shed, one side green with pollen and algae, he threw them open and searched in the dark for his bike. An old musty smell hit his nose, but he did not mind it. He knew the smell from the many times he opened the shed, full of old gas cans, rusted screws, leftover paint, and lawn gear. Amid all the junk, he spotted the red, glowing shine of his bike.\r      He smiled. Time for a ride.\r      He had to work it out of the shed, lifting the handle of the lawn mower to free his bike�s handlebars. A plank of wood also crossed its path, so he threw that to the back of the shed. When he had it free, he left the shed open and guided it through the side corridor of the house that led to the front driveway. Here, he could feel his shoes squeaking in the soggy, freshly rained-on grass. \r      He opened the wooden fence gate that blocked his exit and crossed into his own fantasy land of open road. Before him, an empty street, nothing but houses watching him. Even the houses had yards between them with nothing but sparse oak trees. The air felt cool, and he knew he needed to be fast to enjoy the atmosphere. If he took too long, the sun would catch up to him.\r      The best part about Winsor St., at least in his opinion, was the portal to another world at the end of the road. Even though the sign at the street�s entrance read �Dead End,� Barty knew the truth. If one ventured past the limits of the paved road, through a dip in an empty ditch that crossed through some trees, that person would find another road. This road had been built specifically with thirteen-year-old boys in mind.\r      Once upon a time, before Barty had even been dreamt of, a railroad ran straight through the heart of St. Fischer Parish. This railroad connected the towns of Doverton, Eulina Springs, Mont Linola, LaFreaux, and Gardsdell from West to East. Today, one might never know this, save for the fact that instead of a railroad, a bike path had been paved over it.\r      Thirty-one miles of clean asphalt stretched the Parish from city to city. The Trail had a few rules posted on signs all throughout. The two biggest rules: No motorized vehicles allowed and Trail open from sun up to sun down. Using the Trail, anyone on foot or on wheels could travel all throughout the area. Sometimes, he would ride through great woods, whose trees grew a hundred feet tall. Other times, he would find himself on a bridge over murky, brown and green water, wondering what people or mysteries had been lost to the water long ago. On this Saturday, he only wanted to lose his worries, riding his bike so swiftly they could not keep up.\r      He carefully drove his bike through the dipping path at the end of his street and up onto the paved Trail. He looked left and right, careful not to interrupt a fellow bikers� speedy pace. The Trail looked as if it went on forever in both directions, a tunnel of trees and asphalt. He directed his bike to the left and took off, the trees zipping past him as he picked up speed. Occasionally, he liked to veer off the asphalt onto the horse trails that bordered the bike path. But on this day, he just waved at the people that used them as he sped past.\r      A quarter of a mile flew by, and Barty stood on his pedals to gain more speed. Ahead lay a tunnel that dove beneath a highway that crossed the Trail. He knew that, if he could gain enough momentum on the downhill side, he could come up without pedaling at all. A win, he thought.\r      He pedaled faster, his hair flying back in the wind. The air hitting his face felt colder as he picked up speed. Go, go, go! He thought as he entered the declining ramp to the tunnel. He pushed his bike with all of his might. The tunnel sat at the bottom, a hundred feet ahead.\r      Green bars flanked the sides of the ramp, blurring as he rode. Soon, they gave way to white walls. Then, he hit the smooth concrete floor of the tunnel, the sound of traffic reverberating in the air. The walls had been graffitied and the tunnel felt dark in the middle. He relaxed at the bottom and rode the momentum like a wave. \r      Soon, the incline hit his front wheels. Here waited the true test of his power. He estimated that he must have been flying at twenty-five miles-per-hour. Would his bike make it up the ramp without more pedaling? \r      He rose, still maintaining speed. Then, he noticed the bike begin to slow, his surroundings changing to green bars again. Come on, we can make it! But he could tell, half-way up the tunnel, that it would barely reach the end. He gave a few lighthearted turns with his feet, too tired to put more energy into movement. Then, reaching the top, he coasted forward into another tunnel of trees, leaving the road, with its noisy traffic screaming, behind him. \r      The narrow asphalt curved to the left so tightly, Barty could only see about fifty feet of what lay before him. He hugged the right side of the path tightly incase another biker should meet him head on. On the other side, he came to an intersection where regular street met the Trail. Then, he exited the trail to Mont Linola�s Lakefront area.\r      The Lakefront town area felt like a step back in time. Shops and historic houses lined a near perfect gridwork of streets, massive Live Oak trees forming glorious tunnels above them. Broken sidewalks framed the roads, giving walkers the opportunity to explore. Barty loved this area because he could stop in the local antique shop owned by Mrs. Susan Jennings.\r      The shop appeared more like an old house whose owner could not get rid of any of their possessions. On the outside, broken remnants of houses, vintage doors and shutters, leaned against the white siding. The front landscape had been filled with little ceramic statues of birds, blue, green, and red. A tiny gnome sat by the birdbath in the middle. \r      On the front porch, old signs from different beverage companies had been stuck to the walls. A few bench seats and a porch swing occupied the porch to welcome visitors to enjoy the view. Susan had the door propped open, inviting the cool summer breeze into the stale air of her shop.\r      As Barty climbed the familiar stoop, the smell of old fabric, rust, and mothballs filled his nose. He walked into the front room of the shop, Susan sitting behind the counter on his left. �Hello, again, Barty.� \r      �Hello.�\r      He nodded at her and looked around the room. He did not see anything new, necessarily, but he walked slowly, ritually, taking in the sight of items from the past. He connected with these in an unexplainable way. They soothed his mind, beckoning him to live in a simpler time.\r      As he walked through the rooms, his fingers brushed cold silver on a timeless coffee set. They looked plucked out of an old movie. He unconsciously rolled a wooden car, hand painted and lacquered by someone long gone.\r      The owner had converted a house into a shop. Each room had remnants of someone else�s life lingering like aftereffects of another time. In the back room joined to the entrance, the corner still had cabinets and kitchen features. The back door led to more outdoor artifacts from homes that had either been demolished or remodeled, leaving their bones for another to dig up.\r      Barty walked carefully through each room, trying not to bump into anything. Susan had stacked thin shelves on tables to hold decor, watches, spoons, play jewelry, and cups. He turned into the hallway that connected the kitchen to the bedrooms. Each of these had also been converted into housing spaces for ancient artifacts. The furthest room to the right held coats and dresses and jewelry that reminded him of an old movie.\r      There, a woman stood, her makeup done, wearing a blue floral nightgown that looked aged by time. She herself wore time like a jacket, having been touched by many years. Her wrinkles had crawled like tree roots across her cheeks and under her eyes. Her hair had turned grey.\r      Barty knew her from this exact room, for every time he visited, she lingered there looking at the clothing. Sometimes she stood by the coats, slowly fingering the details and lines. At other times, she sat in the rocker and watched the dazzling dresses swing against the white door where they hung, as each visitor pushed it open to look.\r      Barty stepped cautiously into the room where she stood, watching a blue, sequin dress, for what seemed to be the seventh time that Barty could think of. She muttered under her breath. He could not hear the words, but he could see her thin, lined lips moving. \r      He glanced out the window, feeling awkward. Then he turned to where she stood. The first time he met her, he knew instinctively that something had been off. He had grown used to them, their faint translucency, their muttering and moaning. He could tell their movement made no ripple in space, like the air itself did not recognize them. He had grown so accustomed to real people, he knew the fake instantly.\r      He did not dare ask Mrs. Jennings about her. He already knew what she would say. �Barty, who�s back there? Oh? You scared me. I thought I must have missed someone. Don�t play tricks on me, young man.� No, he had been there too many times before. He knew how it felt when no one believed him.\r      Usually, he would ignore them. Usually, he would avoid their eyes and try to walk away. He did not fear them. They were� him. A figment of his imagination or a part of his brain losing itself. He knew this to be true. But today, he could not help himself.\r      He knew the what. They were hallucinations. But why did they do what they did? Even if they came from his mind, which they did, they operated independently of his will. They had minds of their own. They went where they wanted to and said what they wanted. They even gave him information that he never learned for himself.\r      So, Barty watched her, muttering and frozen, wearing her old nightgown. Her skin was covered in sunspots and bruises, the way elderly people often looked. Her face had thinned into nothing but skin and bones, her grey hair falling on her shoulders, uncut.\r      He moved closer to her, hoping to get a glimpse of what she spoke. Then, quieting his breath, he heard her muttering, �the boy, the boy. What does he want? He listens. He watches.�\r      Barty froze, thinking he had intruded on her space. He stood back, slowly. Then, he reminded himself, she�s not real. He reversed course, walking clearly to her side.\r      Then, she whipped her head to glare at him. Her swift movement had stunned the boy. Her eyes had grown wide and threatening. �What are you looking at?� she demanded, her voice harsh and croaky.\r      �I� why are you here?� He swallowed his fear, his heart racing. �I mean, why are you always here? Every time I come here. You�re here. In this room.�\r      She looked forward at the dress and ran her fingers over the sequins. They did not move when she touched them. Then, softly, she spoke under her breath. �Why should I leave? It�s mine. It�s mine. It�s�� then, as if a brilliant idea had struck her, she smiled brightly and looked at Barty with excitement. �I used to be a dancer, you know.� She turned to look at the dress, her eyes beginning to water.\r      �That�s very cool.� Barty did not know what to do with this information. �Do you like the dress?�\r      She tried to grab it. Her fingers sank through the fabric like a hologram. �It�s mine.�\r      Barty studied the dress. Did one argue with imaginary figures?\r      �Do you ever think about leaving?� Barty asked. \r      �Why would I leave?� She responded. Her voice had a hint of bitterness.\r      �I don�t know. To explore or to see things.� He wondered whether his imaginary friends could go elsewhere at all. What would happen if they tried?\r      �I seen things, boy,� she said, sounding insulted. �I seen the city, the lake, the country. Danced with the governor. I loved. I�� she stopped mid-sentence.\r      �You what?�\r      Her face changed from stern concentration to a look of fascination.\r      �I was a dancer, you know.�\r      Barty knew. \r      �You said that already.�\r      Her face flushed pink momentarily, a rare color that stood out on her white face. �I did? Oh.� She looked into the dress as one would a window, dreaming.\r      Like a lucid dream, Barty had a moment of curiosity. He wanted to prod, to find out what these specters could tell him.\r      �What is your name?� he asked, hoping that this would not offend her.\r      Her lips curled into a soft smile, and she thought. �Florence.�\r      �My name is Barty.�\r      She turned to look at him fully, perhaps for the first time. �Thank you, Barney. I- I,� she stuttered. �I was a dancer, you know.� Then, as if he had disappeared himself, she turned back to the dress, stroking it softly. \r      Barty left her there in the room, continuing to mutter.\r      �Did you find anything interesting today?� asked Mrs. Jennings, looking up from her book.\r      Barty walked to the glass countertop, slowly and carefully. �Mrs. Susan, do you believe in ghosts?�\r      She closed the book and placed it on the counter. �I, uh, I don�t know. Maybe. Why do you ask?�\r      He thought at this moment whether to say something about the old woman in the back room. �Just wondering,� he said, smiling darkly. �You�ve got a lot of old stuff here. Some people say ghosts cling on to their old stuff.�\r      She smiled over her glasses, resembling a cat. �Oh, Barty, then I think I must be in trouble.�\r      With perfect timing, a knocking noise came from the back room. They both looked up, frightened for a moment.\r      Mrs. Jennings spoke again, sounding like she had swallowed a toad. �That�s probably just Fiskers.� Barty understood Fiskers to mean her orange tabby cat that seldom walked around the store. �There�s a woman there on Dapier Street,� she began again. �She does fortune telling, or cards, or something of the sort. But I never mess with that stuff, myself. I�m Presbyterian.�\r      Barty felt a surge of mischief. �There�s ghosts in the Bible, Mrs. Jennings.�\r      She froze, eyes locked on his face. �Oh? That�s,� she said before swallowing, �interesting. I�ll have to look into it.�\r      Barty�s eyes wandered around the room. �I�m sure it�s just exaggerated, of course. Or,� he paused and looked at her again. �I hope.�\r      He had clearly stunned her. Whether or not she enjoyed this, he could not tell. He felt a certain satisfaction when playing with superstitious people. �I�ll see you late, Miss Susan.�\r      �I, uh, okay. I�ll see you later, Barty. Very nice seeing you.�\r      As Barty walked out the door, he caught a glimpse of her hands shaking. She looked toward the back room, clearly moved by the sound. He walked down the steps to his bike, feeling quite sure that the sound had indeed come from Fiskers.\r      He biked the few blocks that led to the Lakefront, perhaps the best part of Mont Linola. A three mile stretch of neatly kept green grass and ancient oak trees lined the shore of Lake Phillipas. Lake Phillipas itself dwarfed the town of Mont Linola by its ocean-like appearance. Indeed, all the towns along the Trail ran along its shore. To the naked eye, it appeared infinitely vast.\r      Barty knew better. On this day, when the rain had just cleaned the atmosphere, one could pear across the lake and see the outline of the large buildings of the City. From the Lakefront shore, he could see the causeway bridge that stretched twenty-six miles from Mont Linola to the other shore. Cars crossed back and forth creating an infinite loop of traffic noise that filled the air.\r      Barty sat on the concrete wall that separated the grass from the dark and cloudy water. He watched the City, sitting there on the skyline. He remembered a trip he once took there and smiled. He had met eyes with a panhandler. He felt frightened by the man. But suddenly, the person shifted shapes into a horrible floating specter, and Barty laughed. Something about the image had brought him peace.\r      �Good show!� He remarked, throwing the figure a dollar.\r      Thinking about this, Barty listened to a new noise. Slow, creeping footsteps crushed grass behind him. Before he could react, hands crashed into his back, forcing him over the edge, into the water.\r      He caught himself as he landed in the knee-deep shallow bank. His sneakers sunk into the soggy sand under the water. Voices cackled behind him, the unmistakable laughter of Beau Adams and Preston Farrell. \r      Barty whipped around, furious. �What the hell!� he shouted at them, standing over the wall. From the ledge, they stood at least seven feet above him.\r      �How�s the water, Barty?� Preston shouted, sitting on the edge. He set a large, half eaten, sandwich down on the wall.\r      In their normal clothes, they somehow appeared dumber than they did at school. Preston wore a tan, athletic tank top, aviator sunglasses, and black athletic shorts. Barty could not see, but he felt certain that the boy�s purple shoes hid behind the concrete ledge.\r      Beau wore reflective, fishing sunglasses. He had an oversized energy drink tee-shirt and khaki cargo shorts. Unfortunately, he fulfilled Barty�s every imagination of his out-of-school alter-ego.\r      Beau then lifted Barty�s bike and cast it over the edge. He made it look so easy, he could have been throwing a football.\r      �Why?!� Barty cried. He knew why. \r      �We thought you might like to bike to your dad,� Preston challenged. �Since he�s probably out there somewhere.� He took another bite of his sandwich, meat flapping out the sides as he set it down.\r      Beau laughed at this, another mark against him on Barty�s wrongs list. Barty attempted to calm himself but began dreaming up revenge schemes as he struggled to lift the bike out of the muck.\r      �No girlfriend to protect you?� Beau asked, clearly trying to say something clever. �Or, uh, boyfriend.�\r      �Shut up, Beau,� Barty shouted, unafraid of the consequences. He knew at the very least, the boys would not come after him while he stayed in the water.\r      Still, Beau ground his teeth, glaring at Barty. Barty imagined the strain he must feel having to think that hard. �Don�t give yourself an aneurysm,� Barty continued.\r      �You think I�m so dumb?� Beau shouted again. �I know you and Mildred did something.�\r      �So did your mom,� Barty�s tongue was moving faster than his brain now. �And look what happened.�\r      Preston chuckled at this, which infuriated Beau. Then, Preston got up and started playing with a bat that he had brought along, pretending to hit some imaginary ball.\r      �It�s easy to make mom jokes when your mom�s dead.� Beau muttered.\r      �No,� Barty started again. �It�s easy to hurt people when that�s the only thing you�re good at. It�s easy to shove people when they�re smaller than you. But you think that makes you tough. That makes you a coward. That makes you�� He stopped himself, afraid that he might literally push Beau over the edge. �Do you have anything else to say? Or do you want to kill me now?�\r      Preston swung the bat again. �You're lucky you�re still walking��\r      A small brown shadow cut him off, forcing the two bullies to jump back. There, where his sandwich rested on the ledge, hardly protected by parchment paper, a small bird had swooped down. Unafraid of the onlookers, it pecked at the seeds on the bread. Its bouncing brown body and speckled underside nearly matched the concrete wall�s color.\r      Preston glared at the bird, his fists gripping the bat. �You little�� He lifted the bat, posing for a swing.\r      Barty could not believe it. He did not want to think that even Preston could do such an awful act, but before he could react, the boy launched. The bird, noticing the movement, started to fly. The bat crashed into its tiny body, midair, sending the bird flapping into the water.\r      �You absolute�� Barty summoned the worst curse word he could think of. He lunged forward in the water to where the bird floated. The flapping wings slowed, struggling to reorient itself in the water. Then, it stopped altogether, Barty feeling helpless as he watched.\r      �If you and Mildred ever come around me again,� Beau said, �I�ll kill you. I swear to god.�\r      �He doesn�t mean that,� Preston interjected.\r      �Yes I do!� Beau replied, sounding hurt. �I�ll throw him off a cliff.� They began walking away, their voices trailing off. The last thing Barty heard was Preston remarking, �We don�t have cliffs.� He noted that Preston left the sandwich there, an eyesore on the wall.\r      Barty looked down at the helpless, dead bird, floating on the water. Something inside him burned. A feeling of rage, empathy, or sadness all combined. The creature had been helpless, small, weak. Preston, comparatively, had been a giant. He saw Gabe in the bird. Maybe even himself. No, I�m not helpless. \r      He never imagined touching a wild animal, certainly not a dead one. Compelled by emotion, he cupped his hands in the water under the bird and lifted it out of the water. It sunk into the skin of his hands as they rose. Barty grit his teeth, trying not to cry.\r      He could feel his palms heating with the anger that pulsed through his body. They started tingling as blood from the animal ran through his fingers. Why? Preston�s nothing but a worm. Nothing but a worm� \r      The bird twitched. Its leg strengthened, as it straightened its torso. Barty almost dropped it, shocked by the revival. Instead, he moved to the large concrete barrier that reach out into the water and set it down. Soon, the bird had completely woken and stood. It twisted its head and gratefully chirped at him.\r      Barty, stunned, waved at it. He shook his hands in the water to rinse the blood and watched as the bird flapped to rid itself of moisture. Then, as if nothing had happened, it flew to the wall and resumed pecking at the sandwich. This filled the boy with delight. Eat the sandwich, friend. \r      \r      Sarah nearly fainted when Barty entered his home, wet up to his thighs and covered in mud. She had been folding laundry in the front room. An episode of Dead Close, a reality show that paired romantic suitors with ghostly lovers, played on the living room television. Barty hated the show, with its over the top host, ranting and raving when mediums �connected� with lonely spirits. \r      �Beau Adams,� he responded in a lifeless tone.\r      �Beau Adams,� she repeated, thinking. �That�s the boy that cut your ear! I told you not to hang around him. No wonder you smell like a turd.�\r      �I didn�t hang around them. I didn�t look for them. They found me at the Lakefront.�\r      �Did you walk the other way? Did you call for help? Did someone see you? Did anyone offer to intervene?�\r      He wondered if mothers acted like this when their children came home hurt or bleeding. �I just wasn�t paying attention, and they pushed me.� He paused and bobbed his head, forming words. �Into the lake.�\r      �INTO THE LAKE?� She shrieked, suspiciously dramatic. �You hate being wet,� she argued. �And that�s assault.� She folded her arms and tapped her foot. Somewhere in the argument, the conversation shifted into silliness.\r      �It is assault. You�re right.� Barty replied flatly. �You call the police. I�m going to go take a nap.�\r      He walked to his room and gathered clothes to wear after showering. In the shower, as the dirt and grime slid down and swirled around the drain, he wished he could rinse off the frustration he felt. Beau said something that almost slipped by him. I know you and Mildred did something. But now, with nothing but his thoughts, he processed the information. What would happen if Beau and Preston told the principal their suspicion? What had Mildred done to them? What did they know?\r      One person brought more questions than answers. One person had shown up at just the right time and place. This person knew more than she should have. And, his brain buzzing with thoughts, Barty knew what to do. He needed to learn more about the new girl that had saved his life.",

        "text": "CHAPTER FOUR\rThe Ghost in the Hall\r      On Monday morning, Sarah drove Barty to school, a gesture of kindness.\r      �Beau and Preston were expelled,� she informed him on the way. �Got the call yesterday.�\r      Barty smiled. At least his plan had worked. �What about the other boy?�\r      She did not know the answer to that.\r      When he arrived at school, the halls reverberated with gossip about the fight.\r      �Beau tried to kill Barty!� A boy with blonde hair that stood straight up said. �But Barty�s girlfriend, Kelly, protected him. They�ve been going out.� Barty rolled his eyes. He passed by a group of cheerleaders chatting outside their home room. Their eyes followed him as he walked, and they suddenly began whispering to each other. He could hear a boy telling an exaggerated version of the story to a small group of the chess team. �So, Barty pulled out his own knife! They dueled in knife to knife combat.� Nonsense, he thought.\r      �Barty, she�s coming for you.� Mildred�s voice whispered in his ear. But when Barty turned to see her, she had disappeared. Of course, he thought. Instead, amongst the crowd of students heading to classes and exchanging notes, he saw five pink bows bobbing on the sea of hairstyles. Kelly Prescott led her group of preppy pinks in his direction.\r      �BARTY BEAUREGARD!� She called out, the words ringing in his ears.\r      He turned to escape, but the wall of students blocking his path made it near impossible. In fact, students had begun gathering to watch when they heard his name in the air.\r      �Barty! What a surprise!� Kelly began. \r      �Surprise?� Barty questioned. �We see eachother everyday.�\r      She giggled with her band of Preppy Pinks, each nodding their agreement. �Well, I�m still happy to see you, Pookie.� She sounded almost giddy. \r      �Pookie? Okay.� Barty backed up as she moved closer to him, trapped by the group of gathered students. �What�s going on?�\r      �You must know by now, Barty dear.� She moved closer to him, innocently twisting her hair with her pointer finger. �Preston won�t be able to take me to the dance anymore. Beau is also out of the picture. I just figured, since we always flirt and tease��\r      �Flirt and tease?!� Barty cut in. Her perfume tickled his nose with lavender petals.\r      �Oh course. You don�t think I really hate you?� Her eyes had become huge and desperate, like a baby looking for attention. �The way I see it, it only makes sense.�\r      Barty felt he knew what came next. �I thought you never dreamed about going out with me? You want me to take you to the dance?�\r      She grinned. �Yes! Of course I�ll go with you!� She threw her arms around his neck.\r      �Kelly, I wasn�t asking you�� but it was too late. Kelly Prescott had already begun marching down the hallway. Everyone had seen the interaction. She had trapped Barty and he had nowhere to run.\r      �I�ll talk to you at lunch, Pookie!� Off she went. \r      Barty watched her leave, not out of romantic longing, but out of exhaustion. He scratched the back of his head, wondering what had happened.\r      Throughout his classes, students whispered his name. Teachers used him as their �volunteer.� In chemistry, he helped the teacher light her hands on fire with methane bubbles. The experiment backfired when his sleeve caught fire. In history, the teacher opined on whether or not Barty could be related to the famous Civil War general under the same surname. He hated this association. All the attention had started to get to him. When he crossed paths with Mildred between classes, he thought about her ability to vanish. He longed for her talent. Could she teach him a thing or two?\r      At lunch, Kelly cornered him again and forced him to sit with her. He felt compelled. But all the time, he watched for Mildred to show up, but she never appeared.\r      �So I�ll be wearing pink. You have to wear pink as well, Barty.� She did not stop talking the entire lunch period. She told him the flowers she wanted and the expensive rental store where he could get a pink tuxedo.\r      �Okay, yeah.� Barty half listened. He would run the moment he got the chance.\r      When he finally pulled away from Kelly, he went straight to the school counselor�s office. Barty would see the councilor as part of the principal�s plan for �establishing trust� with Barty and Mildred�s guardians.\r      As he arrived, Mildred exited the office.\r      �Barty!� Her eyes lit up when she saw him.\r      �Hello,� he responded, unsure what to say.\r      �Mr. Friend is nice. You�ll hate him.� \r      Barty blinked. �Mr. Friend? That has to be a joke.�\r      It was no joke. Mr. Friend stood in the open doorway, beaming down at the two of them.\r      �Oh! Sweet babies!� He had thick brown glasses, curly hair, and a tan sweater vest. �Come in, Mr. Beauregard! I�ve been looking forward to this all day!�\r      Mr. Friend had a flamboyant kindness that made the room feel electric. He had decorated his office with posters that read, �Happiness is a change of perspective,� or �You can succeed!�\r      Barty hated it.\r      �Take a seat. Take a seat.� He motioned to the big leather seat in front of his desk. He sat in the accompanying chair next to Barty.\r      �Barty, tell me about yourself!�\r      Barty did not know what to say. He did not enjoy speaking to strangers, especially when mandated by the school. Something also seemed familiar about this man, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\r      �I�m thirteen,� he began. \r      �I remember thirteen!� Mr. Friend somehow always sounded on the verge of tears. �What an exciting age! Tell me more.�\r      Barty felt uncomfortable at his enthusiasm for discussion. But he trucked on. By the end of their hour-long session, he had discussed his mother�s death, his missing father, his caretaker, and his fear of tightly enclosed spaces.\r      As they began to wrap up, Mr. Friend typed a few notes on his computer. Then he turned to Barty, who had started to feel comforted by the discussion. �Barty, it�s been wonderful getting to know you. I hope we can be friends!� He smiled a big toothy grin. �Just know that you can tell me anything, and I can�t tell a single soul.� \r      �Really?� Barty replied.\r      �Oh really!� He nodded aggressively. �With a few exceptions, of course. Like if someone was hurting you, or you planned to hurt someone else. Or planned to have someone hurt. But, you�d never do that, of course, now would you.� His smile looked sinister all of the sudden.\r      �I, uh,� Barty could not find words. He felt bothered by the way the statement had been phrased. Did Mr. Friend know about his scheme?\r      Suddenly it hit him. That day in the cafeteria, the day Preston asked Kelly to the dance, an adult had been watching Barty. Barty now fully realized that Mr. Friend had been that adult in the room. Barty felt the anxiety in his head sending signals to the rest of his body.\r      Mr. Friend stood and walked to the door. As he passed Barty�s chair he lightly placed his hand on the boy�s shoulder. The hand made Barty shiver. He could feel the cold through his shirt.\r      �I�ll see you next week, Mr. Beauregard.� He smiled again, peering over his glasses. As Barty exited, the scent of peppermint hit his nose. He had seen peppermints on the desk in a small bowl. Mr. Friend had apparently put one in his mouth.\r      �No need to hide anything from me,� the man said.\r      Barty nodded and walked away from the man, the tension easing with each step.\r      \r      Barty started toward the one place at Mont Linola he could find solitude: the Hell Hall.\r      As he walked, heads turned in his direction. He suddenly felt as if the air conditioning had stopped working. He hated being warm. Sweat dripped down from his forehead. Why do I feel this way? He questioned. \r      At the entrance to the Hell Hall, red light glowed, all other light nonexistent. He stepped into the darkness, silence permeating his body. He breathed deeply, taking in the stale, cool air that had not been breathed by other humans. Eyes closed, he walked slowly, bathed in solitude.\r      An echo of a voice woke him. Barty Beauregard? The words seemed to come from within his own mind. The boy peered in the darkness, squinting to make out a person. Further down the hall, the faint shape of a girl stood, patiently waiting.\r      �Yes?� Barty called. �Is that you, Laurie?�\r      The girl drifted toward him, her face and clothes red from the dim light of the exit sign.  She moved so smoothly, she could have been floating. Barty dismissed the idea at once.\r      �I knew you�d come back here,� the girl spoke. She had been dressed the same as before, in her school uniform, wearing a letterman jacket.\r      Barty wondered what the chances could be of her running into him at this exact place and time. She must have known about the fight, and decided to wait for him.\r      Barty responded, �I have an update, if you haven�t already heard.�\r      �He�s gone,� she replied. �I can feel it.�\r      Barty lowered his eyebrows. She could feel it?\r      �Yeah, well, your brother is safe now.�\r      At these words, she lowered her face and smiled in satisfaction.\r      �It was quite involved on my part. Your friend, Mildred, helped as well. She really saved my skin.�\r      The girl stopped her movements and floated toward him. �Oh, I heard something about that. Those boys were up to something. She told me about it.�\r      Barty�s lust for information piqued. �What did she tell you?�\r      The girl covered her mouth and shook her head. �I shouldn�t have said anything.�\r      �But you did,� Barty�s annoyance rose. �Please! Beau could have killed me. I need to know what they were doing. Why was she following them?�\r      The girl only shook her head again. �I�m good at keeping secrets Barty. You should know how important a friend�s trust is.�\r      He did, in fact, not have many friends in which to trust. �Well, there is still the issue of payment, Laurie.�\r      She blushed. �Of course. A deal is a deal.� She moved backward to locker 402. �In here.�\r      She waved her hand over the lock, and it popped open obediently. Barty�s eyes grew. \r      �Nice trick,� he remarked.\r      �Come. Take your payment.�\r      He opened the locker and peered inside. He had not been prepared for what lay there. It had been adorned with dead flowers. Pictures of Laurie had been taped to the walls. Students had written messages on the photos, and left letters. This made Barty uneasy. He laid his eyes on what seemed to be a memorial for Laurie. The only problem being that she lived and breathed beside him.\r      �In the books. The one in the middle. Open it,� she instructed.\r      Barty looked up at the shelf and grabbed a book in the middle, titled Mont Linola Junior High, 2000. Laurie looked no older than fourteen. Why would she have such an old yearbook? He opened the book to a gap in the middle and pulled out five twenty dollar bills. He folded them and put them in his pocket.\r      �Laurie, why do you have this old yearbook in here?� He surveyed the locker again. �What�s with the notes and pictures? Is this some sort of joke?�\r      She stood further back than he remembered, looking straight forward. Something had changed in her appearance. Though the light had been red, she now seemed to glow orange.\r      Thank you, Barty. The words echoed in his mind. Barty looked around for a speaker. The words had been loud and clear. \r      He felt uneasy. Something in the atmosphere had changed. He could have sworn that a mist had formed in the corridor, making the light hazy and dull.\r      �What�s happening?� He said, slightly afraid. The ends of the hall had stretched, as if the hallway went on forever.\r      I hope you find what you�re looking for. Again, she spoke directly to his mind. \r      Then, she played the oddest trick. Her body glowed even brighter, shifting from orange to light of all colors. Of course, not her whole body at once. It seemed as though she had been made of stained glass, light covering her in rainbow patterns. She glowed ever brighter, until Barty had to cover his eyes. He lifted his arm over his face. He did not bring it down until the light had gone.\r      Then, returning it to his side, she had vanished.\r      At once, he looked at both ends of the hall. The ends had returned to their normal lengths. The mist had gone. Finally, he realized that he had been breathing quite hard.\r      He did not know where the light had come from nor the mist. He looked at locker 402, and closed the door. But he did not lock it again.\r      Then, it hit him. He had made a grave mistake. The girl, the room, the lock, the mission, had all been a trick. Who played the trick, he did not know, but he knew immediately that Laurie had been one of them. \r      How could he have been so fooled? He should have seen it, but in the darkness, in the red light of the Hell Hall, he missed it. He missed her. And consequently, he had fooled himself.\r      What have I done? he thought. Barty, under the impression of doing a good deed, had single-handedly gotten two boys expelled. Of course, these boys deserved it, certainly. But could he allow imaginary figures to direct his very real actions? He had stepped further into delusion. Somehow, he had imagined the lock opening. What about the money? Had he planted it himself?\r      �Barty,� Mildred spoke behind him, interrupting his cascading deluge of thought.\r      �What Mildred?� He turned to look at her.  She looked normal, or at least, normal for her.\r      �Did you see that?� Her eyes squinted. �Are you okay?�\r      Too stunned to speak, he gazed at her face and thought about how kind she looked despite her hard external style. When finally he felt as though he could speak again, the words strained on their way out.\r      �I�� He mumbled.\r      �What, Barty?�\r      �I� think� you�� It felt like being in a dream. \r      �You think what, Barty?�\r      �I think you should,� his eyes drooped as his body became limp. �Bring me to a hospital.�\r      He stumbled, then fell into her arms. The room swirled round and round as the darkness closed in. Then, he fell to the ground asleep.\r      \r      When finally he woke, he found himself in the nurse�s station. The nurse stood there, fanning his face with a paper folder.\r      �Barty,� she commanded. �Barty Beauregard. That is your name?�\r      Barty lazily opened his eyes. �Y-Yes?�\r      The nurse walked to the opposite side of the room and ran some water from the faucet into a paper cup.\r      �Here, dear. Take this. Drink.�\r      Barty obeyed. He had been reclining in a chair, but now he attempted to sit up.\r      �No, no, no, Barty. Don�t get up so fast. You�ll just pass out again.�\r      Barty laid back again into the chair and drank the water, the cool liquid running down his throat. He felt grounded in reality again.\r      �Your friend, Mildred came and got me as soon as you passed out,� the nurse said. �She said you had a panic attack. Have you had those before?�\r      Barty felt embarrassed at the answer. �Yes, I have.� He looked straight at the wall, frustrated.\r      �Barty, are you on anxiety medication? How often does this happen?�\r      �I am,� he said. He had been on pills for a year now. He thought if he could control the anxiety, he would stop seeing people that did not exist. The harder he fought, the worse he felt. And yet again, a girl shows up that should not be.\r      �Well, next time you start to panic like this, you need to sit down and relax.�\r      He understood the truth in that statement. But how could he relax when he had supposedly seen a ghost? They�re not real. It�s just a figment if my imagination, he reassured himself. \r      He thought about asking the nurse her thoughts. Maybe he had had some sort of psychotic episode. But this he would not do.\r      �Miss Gerard,� he used her last name. �I know that a girl died here a while ago. What happened?�\r      She frowned. This line of questioning disturbed her.\r      �It was before I worked here, Barty.�\r      Barty pressed further. �But have you heard about it?�\r      She stood up again, and walked to the cabinet. She pulled out some pain killers. �Does your head hurt?� Barty nodded agreement. He took the pills willingly.\r      Then, the nurse sighed.\r      �I heard about it. If I�m not mistaken, it happened by accident. She died in the school swimming pool. Some kids had pushed her in. It was some sort of horrible joke gone wrong.�\r      Barty felt that he had heard enough. This did not ease his discomfort. Someone had to be playing a prank on him using this old story. Did someone learn about his propensity to see people that did not exist?\r      The nurse told him that she would be contacting his guardian to let them know about the incident. He thanked her for her care and left, feeling worse than when he had gone in.\r      As he exited the doorway, Principal Green stopped him, wearing his navy blue, pinstripe suit and bow tie. He wore a variation of this outfit everyday. The students suspected that he mowed the grass and went to bed in a suit. \r      �Barty,� he said, placing his hands on Barty�s shoulders. This made Barty squirm slightly, uncomfortable with being touched. �Are you alright? I heard from the nurse that something had happened to you in the hallway.�\r      Barty, embarrassed that yet another person had heard of his fainting spell, attempted to sound put together. �I�m fine. I just needed to eat something.�\r      The principal eyed the boy, skeptical of his response. �What were you doing, hanging around the C Hall? Most students don�t go in there, I might add. We don�t even keep the lights on.�\r      The boy thought carefully about his response. He did not want to give Principal Green a reason to suspect him of anything. �I take it for that reason, Principal Green. I enjoy the quiet. It soothes me after classes.�\r      The man raised his eyebrows and removed his hands from Barty�s shoulders. Barty felt the tension release in his shoulders, previously unaware of how tight the grip had been. He felt as if the hands had left a lasting impression.\r      �Alright, Barty. I wanted to make sure you weren�t�� he hesitated. �Running into trouble, ey? No need to look for it. Trouble tends to show up when we least expect it.�\r      Barty swallowed, analyzing the man in return. �Do you mean that you think I�m looking to get beat up?�\r      �No. Of course not! I can�t imagine anyone would desire that.� They stared at each other momentarily.\r      �I really must go, Principal Green.� He did not move yet. \r      �Ah, mustn�t be late, Barty. A timely one, you are.� He smiled, looking rather insincere. �One more thing, Barty.�\r      �Yes?�\r      �If you find anything out about the incident, it might be best to bring it directly to me.� He chucked. �No need to worry the students, or their parents, without cause, after all.�\r      Suspicious, Barty nodded, making a mental note. Mr. Green� Pay attention, Barty.\r      The final bell rang soon after departing from the nurses station, and students rushed to collect last minute items from their lockers. He too walked the hall, his hand feeling the folded twenty dollar bills in his pocket. It was a prank, a joke, or a trick of the mind, he reassured himself. The incident had carved a space where imagination transformed into behavior, and Barty had two choices: go further into the Hell Hall or run away.\r\rCHAPTER FIVE\r Melora Freedman\r      Over the next few days, Barty spent his free periods in the school library researching old newspaper archives. He read online obituaries and combed through school records. Certainly, such a tragedy would have imprinted the school in some way. He found one article from that year, detailing the story. It read as follows:",

        "text": "OCTOBER 1st, 2000\rPOOL DROWNING AT MONT LINOLA JUNIOR HIGH LEAVES COMMUNITY IN SHOCK\r      Parents and students at Mount Linola Junior High School are mourning the loss of a beloved student, Melora Freedman, 14, after a tragic incident that happened Friday night. \r      Melora and five other students (un-named) went for a swim at the school swimming pool after midnight. Faculty seemed unaware of their plan to swim. We spoke to the principal, Mr. Gaylord, and he told us that swimming without permission is strictly forbidden, especially with no lifeguard on duty.\r�This is a tragic incident that never should have happened. The kids snuck into the pool, and they knew better,� said Mr. Gaylord.\r      Police are investigating the incident, but as of right now, they suspect no foul play.\r      Melora was beloved by all her teachers and fellow students. Her mother wants the public to know, �Please don�t let your kids do this. Watch your babies. She was a star. No mother should ever have to go through this.�\r- Frank Gritzer, THE TIMES OF ST. FISHER\n\nInitially, Barty hoped that the article could shed light on Laurie. Instead, Frank Gritzer of the Times of St. Fisher only mocked him. Not even a picture accompanied the record with which Barty could compare to Laurie. Now, Barty had more questions. The nurse had mentioned Melora had been pushed, but the article did not mention this detail. Could it have been covered up? Don�t start looking for ghosts, he thought to himself. He had enough on his mind.\r      If you asked him why he visited the pool the next day, he would not know. He would say, �I just strolled, and there it was waiting.� He walked past the entrance of the natatorium, and the blue water called from the other side of the door�s glass. He had not been looking. And when at first he approached the water, he saw nothing.\r      He could smell bleach and feel the warmth of moisture in the air. His footsteps bounced on the walls at the end of the room. Against the concrete walls, painted grey and white, metal benches waited for swimmers to rest. The only light in the room came from big square windows stacked high on the walls. \r      He stared deep into the water. What are you hiding? he thought. He could have been speaking to the school itself. But this water, this pool, had a deeper secret that it kept to itself. He wondered whether, in twenty years, had the water been changed? Or had the faculty simply bleached it again and again. Could the water that stared up at him be the same water that filled the lungs of Melora Freedman, all those years ago?\r       But it was not water that watched him in that pool house. No, from the depth of the pool, a set of eyes, clear and bright, blinked in the dark. Barty squinted to make out the face. He inched closer, leaning further in. There, right in the middle, in the deepest part, a girl stood staring up at him. Barty understood without thinking. Laurie, the girl he had only met in the Hell Hall, stood under the water. Her stare turned into a grin, satisfied with his glance.\r      Barty did not start. No, Barty froze. His eyes opened wider, as if he could see for the first time in his life. She only mouthed the word �hello.� Instinctively, Barty lifted his hand in greeting, leaning ever closer. He could have fallen in to meet her. She grew closer as he fell forward, losing his balance. In an instant, he would be wet from head to foot.\r      Someone grabbed him by the arm.\r      The effect of the catch had done more than rescue him from a day of wet clothes. It had simultaneously jerked him out of a trance. He looked around at his rescuer, at the face of Mildred. But she did not smile. Instead, concern written like a warning sign on her face, she spoke slowly. �Are you alright?�\r      Barty looked at her in shock, then down at the water. The ghostly image of Laurie had gone now, too soon to point out. \r      �What, what happened,� Barty had to think about every word. His mind had been skipping like a bad internet connection. �Did you, did you see?�\r      �I saw,� Mildred said. �I saw the same thing you saw.�\r      �So, I�m not crazy?� Barty held little comfort with this realization. He had stepped from delusion to despair in a singular moment.\r      �I didn�t say that.� She grinned. �I said I saw her in the hall. I saw her vanish, same as you.�\r      He waited. For what, he did not know. But he wanted to take in the moment. For the first time that he could remember, someone had seen what he saw. And of course it had been her. Everywhere Barty paused to think, he saw Mildred, like a specter in slow motion, everyone else a blur. The question that lingered in his mind, can I trust her? In this moment, he knew. In this sprinkle of time, he could share a drop of kinship with a fellow person. Something happened in that hall, and they both knew it. For the first time in his life, he had a friend.\r      They stood in the bus line, waiting to leave. His eyes, as they usually did, moved from detail to detail. He loathed the students clowning and the noise of the air brakes, squealing as the buses slowed. But today, his eyes drifted to the people walking on the sidewalks outside of the school parking area.\r      The neighborhood around the school had become busier than normal. But amid the joggers and dog walkers, a stranger sat, staring at the boarding students. Something about his oversized clothing, a bit too big for his body, stood out to Barty. Tall and lanky, it seemed as though the correct size did not exist for him. But his appearance did not stir Barty to dread. Rather, the intensity with which he eyed the students, made Barty wonder if the man had been watching him.\r      �Mildred,� he spoke softly. �Do you believe in ghosts?�\r      She turned her head toward him. �Why?�\r      �I�m just struggling to believe, I think.�\r      �Believe in ghosts?�\r      �No,� He shuffled his feet, hands in his pockets. �I�m struggling to believe they don�t exist.�\r      She nodded, noticing his attention elsewhere. She glanced in the direction that he looked and saw the man.\r      �He gives me the creeps,� she said.\r      �Me too,� Barty straightened his voice. �But not, like, a ghost. Just like a person.�\r      She smirked in his direction.\r      �People scare me more than ghosts, Barty.�\r      An obnoxious noise interrupted their musing. Kelly Prescott had just boarded the black sports car that had come for her. She rolled her window down immediately and hung out the side. �Bye, Barty! Don�t forget your suit!� She rode down the driveway, the car horn honking at every car.\r      �Mildred,� Barty said, forgetting his ghostly concerns. �Would you be interested in helping me get out of my date with Kelly?�\r      Mildred watched Kelly drive down the road. Her eyes glistened at the idea. �I would love to help,� she replied.\r      After giving Mildred his number, she promised to call him later that night from her foster parent�s house phone. �They still have one of those?� Barty inquired.\r      She shrugged. �They�re old.�\r      On the phone that night, they brainstormed ideas. �We could cut her hair off�� Mildred suggested the day after in the school hallway. But Barty said that she would just wear a wig. Barty thought about finding a way to make her sick the night of the dance. He did not say this out loud. What if he would want to go with someone else? He would need more advanced notice than the day of the dance.\r      They thought of faking a free vacation the day of the dance. �Too elaborate,� Mildred said. �Plus, she�s rich. She probably goes on vacations all the time. She wouldn�t miss her school dance.� Mildred suggested they get her banned from the dance. �That could work,� Barty thought for a moment about Beau and Preston. �But then again, I�m not sure I want to get anyone else in trouble right now.�\r      They began sitting together at lunch, when she did not disappear, as she often did. In between periods, they walked together and winked in the hall, like co-conspirators, hatching a plan.\r\t�Barty, I do have an idea,� she said one afternoon. �It�s harmless, except for her reputation.�\r      She gave him that sly grin that he had come to enjoy. �I�m listening,� he returned.\r      The following morning, Barty looked for Mildred, but did not see her anywhere. The school had a population of about thirteen hundred, a small number, but not nothing. Even with such a population, Mildred stuck out like a weed among grass.\r      He enjoyed this about her. She largely kept to herself, something they had in common. The way she talked only to necessary people felt akin to himself. But she put electric energy into every conversation, with almost sinister intention. He felt she desired to disrupt the status quo, whatever or wherever that meant.\r      He dismissed these thoughts. I have classes, after all, he thought. Grades still mattered. He needed to focus. The lessons and lectures seemed duller than normal that day, but for his history class. His teacher discussed the Freedmen's Bureau, after the American Civil War, and its opposition. Anything Civil War related always kept his attention.\r      But between classes and at lunch, he ducked and dodged people he knew, especially Kelly. She usually sniffed him out like a hound looking for its favorite place to pee. Somehow, Kelly�s sudden obsession with him made him feel worse than her mocking.\r      Barty loathed the tales of his fight with Beau, even if his peers thought him the hero. But he preferred that kind of attention compared to hearing whispers of �Barty and Kelly.� \r      Barty had unfortunately overheard the school�s couple nickname for him and Kelly. �Barkelly,� a girl mentioned as she retrieved books from her locker. �Barty and Kelly! I never thought they�d get together, but it�s giving goals.� Barkelly? Barty thought. That sounds more like broccoli, his least favorite vegetable. \r      �Barty!� Kelly�s voice woke him from thought. �Barkelly is all the rage right now. How does it feel being popular for once?�\r      �Not good,� Barty replied.\r      She had found him reading in the library. The room had been quiet and dark. Barty found solitude there, except for a brief encounter with Mr. Friend as he left the area. When Kelly peaked through the door window and noticed Barty reading in peace, she chose to disrupt him.\r      Kelly giggled at his response. �You�re so funny, Barty.� Barty glared at her with a deadpan look.\r      �What do you want Kelly?� He cut right to the point. She grinned.\r      �I just wanted to see my Barty Arty.� Barty�s eyebrows rose. �And to remind you that the school thinks we look great together.�\r      �And?� Barty had grown tired of Kelly�s false attempts at casual conversation. He perceived that she spoke every word with selfish ambition.\r      �I need you to know that there is nothing in this world that I want more than to go to the dance with you.� Her grin lowered into a darker, more threatening look. �And nothing in this world will stop that from happening.�\r      Barty closed the book he was reading and plopped it on the desk. �What�s that supposed to mean, Kelly? Speak plainly.�\r      She stepped forward menacingly. Only the desk separated them, and Barty felt like he needed more space. Before he could move, her hands gripped the sides of the desk. She leaned in, her face inching closer to him.\r      �I know you don�t want to go with me, Barty. I�m well aware.� Barty could feel the breath coming off of her words. �But you will go with me. If I have to stuff you and mount you on a stick, you will go with me.�\r      Barty, stunned, leaned his chair back, trying to get away. �Why do you care so much? Why me?�\r      She grabbed his collar, her grip like a gorilla, and pulled their faces together. Her breath smelled of mint.\r      �Because I know about the games you like to play,� she whispered aggressively. �And no matter how dumb you think I am, I assure you. I know enough to beat you.� She smiled, winked, and pecked his nose with a kiss.\r      Barty did not know what to think. Could it be possible that she had caught onto his scheme? The tone in which she spoke felt intentional. She knew something. But how could she know?\r      She stood up straight, and tilted her head, smiling again. �Okay, Pookie?� Then she turned straight around, and marched to the door. �Don�t forget your tux!�\r      When she had finally gone, Barty watched the door, wondering what had just happened. Now the solitude felt more like loneliness, but not because of the lack of people. He craved the company of friends, a feeling most unusual.\r      That evening, Barty performed his nightly ritual with a hopeful feeling. He had longed all that day to speak on the phone with Mildred. He had burned with suspense, thinking about their plan and wondering if she found success.\r      When he dialed her home, he counted the seconds that he waited for her to pick up. He could feel his heart beating in his chest like a drum. His breath seemed to hurt in his lungs. Why did he feel so on edge? He could not explain it.\r      The ringing stopped as a sound clicked on the other side. �Hello?� A stern sounding man had answered the phone. Barty had not prepared for this. Of course he knew someone else could pick up the line, but he had not considered what to say.\r      The words dropped out of his mouth like a stopping faucet, �Is�er� Mildrid there? It�s Barty from school,� he tried to say this warmly, to instill trust. �Barty Beauregard.�\r      �Beauregard?� The man sounded curious. �Like the general?�\r      Barty looked down, exasperated. �No relationship.�\r      The man seemed to ponder for a moment. Then, he spoke. �I�ll see if I can get her. Hold on.�\r      Barty indeed held on, to his shaking legs and his computer desk, which bounced in rhythm. A shuffle occurred on the other end, then words came again. �Hello? Barty?� Mildred spoke these words.\r      Barty immediately felt the tension in his body release. �What took you so long?�\r      �I was in the bathroom,� She replied.\r      �No, I mean at school today,� \r      He could hear her putting something in her mouth and chewing. Mildred liked to eat. She paused chewing and spoke again. �I handled everything. Don�t worry, I�ve done this before.�\r      �I have been thinking�� he began. He detailed the contents of the locker and the school yearbook. He told her about the newspaper article and the nurse�s account. Then, after hearing what he had to say, she responded in a way that perhaps Barty suspected she might.\r      �Barty, we both saw it,� she responded. �You know it, you�re just afraid to say it out loud. But I�m not afraid to say it. Laurie was, or is, Melora Freedman.� \r      Now that the words had been released into the air, they sounded insane.\r      �I� I have a hard time accepting that.� He waited for Mildred to argue with him. But instead she took another bite of food, the crunching coming in loud over the phone.\r      �Why not?� She asked, through the sound of chomping. �Are you afraid of ghosts?�\r      When Barty saw Laurie vanish in the Hell Hall, he did feel afraid. He felt so afraid that he fainted. But why? Why had the apparition left him feeling so broken? Many people feared ghosts. Why should he be any different?\r      �I�m afraid of the implications,� he stated. �Besides, there�s probably a logical explanation.� Or is there, Barty?\r      �Why don�t we just find out?� She replied. �If you�re up for a little investigation.�\r      Barty smiled. �Let�s.�\r      \r\tMonday morning came soon enough. They agreed to venture back together into the Hell Hall, to locker 402. �There�s probably a picture of Melora in the yearbook,� Mildred suggested. If she was a ghost, it should be easy to verify. They simply needed to find an image of the dead girl to verify. Barty agreed.\r\t�There�s no harm in checking.� He reasoned that if the two girls were not the same, then a picture would clear his mind.\r\tHe ate lunch with Mildred, discussing their plans. The cafeteria provided a sense of privacy, because their words could drift into the already present static of conversations. If they discussed something interesting, no one would notice.\r      The menu that day consisted of pizza and salad, and Barty could not stomach pizza. He stabbed his straw into a plastic pouch of milk. �We need to find Gabe.� Gabe was the name of Laurie�s brother.\r      �Would she be upset that you contacted him?� Mildred asked. She had already lifted a large slice of pepperoni to her mouth.\r      �As long as it isn�t too obvious who we are, we�ll be fine,� Barty replied, surveying the room. He always did this, especially when scheming. �How well did you know her?�\r      �Not well,� Mildred replied. �I only ever saw her in the Hell Hall. We ran into each other a few times.�\r      Barty noticed Kelly and her crew walking their trays to a table a few yards away. Barty averted his eyes, hoping she would not notice him.\r      �What?� Mildred asked.\r      Barty motioned with his head. She looked over his shoulder to see the familiar bows of pink moving behind him. \r      Kelly paused behind Barty and looked at the back of his head.\r      �Oh, hello broccoli hair!� Kelly intended this for Barty. Barty�s face flushed, breathing a sigh of exhaustion. �Hello, Kelly.� He turned to greet her.\r      �Oh, so you sit with other girls now?� Kelly used a playful tone. Barty could not tell if she really felt upset. �Lap it up now, goth girl.�\r      Mid-bite, Mildred covered her mouth and turned to the side. She clearly wore a coy smile.\r      �What�s so funny?� Kelly demanded.\r      �It�s just funny,� Mildred replied. �I had no idea you two were that close.�\r      Kelly folded her arms. �It�s not proximity, Smelldrid.� Her goons chuckled at the nickname. �Its possession. My runaway pup is still my pup.�\r      �Oh, I think you misunderstand.� She motioned the space between her and Barty. �This is nothing. You can have him. You might regret it though.�\r      �Why�s that?� Kelly could not help playing along.\r      �Oh, don�t worry about it.� She winked at Barty. �Your kids are gonna be cute.� When Mildred winked, Kelly burned with rage. This thoroughly entertained Barty. \r      Kelly bit her lip. �Barty, you better watch your friend. She�s going to get you in trouble.�\r      Barty did not find this funny. He lightly kicked Mildred under the table. She returned the kick, but did not hold back.\r      �Oof!� Barty winced.\r      �Let�s go,� Kelly commanded her band of Preppy Pinks. With that, she marched away to find a table further away. Barty noticed a few of the other kids in the area snickering as she walked. \r      After lunch, the time had come. Barty made his way, a bit more slowly this time, to the office of Mr. Friend. Mildred had already departed for her next class. So, he walked alone. Even walking slowly, it took little time to come to the door. He knocked on the wood of the door, and it opened almost immediately.\r      �Hello, Barty!� Mr. Friend greeted him with his familiar smile. Barty noticed that it felt warm and overzealous again, devoid of malice. He distinctly lacked any air of suspicion. Did I misunderstand last time? Barty considered the possibility. He resolved not to let his guard down. He could not afford a teacher prying into his business.\r      As they sat, Mr. Friend began to speak. �Barty, I�m a little concerned about you.� \r      �What?� Barty, already on guard, shook as he replied. �What did you hear? Did something happen?�\r      Mr. Friend raised his hands, revealing his palms, as if being held up. �Nothing, Barty. I just heard about your weak spell the other day!�\r      Barty sank into his chair. He should have been prepared. �Who told you?�\r      Mr. Friend stirred his coffee cup. �Miss Gerard told me. She thought I should know. She was very worried about you.�\r      Barty could not hide his disappointment and embarrassment. He wore it on his face like a mask. He looked up and met Mr. Friend�s concerned eyes. \r      �Don�t be upset that she told me,� Mr. Friend assured. �She was just doing her job.� His eyes looked big and glossy. �Are you okay? What happened?�\r      Barty did not know what to say. This part of his school experience had blown up within him, causing pressure within.\r      �I just� I think I�ve just been stressed out,� he tried to downplay the incident. �I thought I might have been seeing things.�\r      �In the C Hall? Is that where you were?� Barty understood the C Hall to be the formal name for the Hell Hall.\r      �Yes, I think,� Barty shifted in his seat. �The students call it the Hell Hall.�\r      Mr. Friend grinned, leaning back in his seat. �Ah, yes. The �Hell Hall.� I�ve heard the stories. They�re just stories, though. There�s no reason to be afraid there.�\r      Barty felt that his intelligence had been questioned. �I know. I think its a medication side effect. I�m not afraid of the Hell Hall.�\r      �So, you think that maybe you fainted as a side effect of your medicine?� The school counselor leaned in, intrigued and caring. �How long have you been on it?�\r      �A year or so,� Barty replied.\r      �But you�ve only recently started�what did you say? Seeing things?� He scratched his chin. �What did you see, exactly? Spots?�\r      Barty felt safe. Maybe he really had misunderstood Mr. Friend. He breathed deeply, like the air in the room had been cleaned before he came in. What a great thought, he said to himself. He relaxed. Mr. Friend had put effort into making the room comfortable and welcoming. The overhead lights stayed off. Instead, four lamps lit every inch of the room. A small radio in the corner played a soft tune quietly in the background.\r      He focused on the song for a moment, letting the melody fill his ears.\r      �I�� Barty allowed himself to trust. Don�t get comfortable, Barty, he reminded himself. Don�t give up too much. But at that moment, he could not contain the emotion within him. He felt a tear begin to roll down his face. He felt like he could see the room and the ambience, but not fully contain his movements.\r      �It�s okay, Barty,� Mr. Friend said, encouraging him to continue. He reached for a tissue and handed it to Barty. The boy gratefully took it. �Go on. I won�t judge you.�\r      Barty had resolved not to say anything that could be connected with Beau Adams. Certainly, a ghost asking for Beau Adams to be expelled counted. But perhaps he could let a little out, without the dots connecting? No! Barty stood firm in his mind. Don�t say a word about anything.\r      His mouth opened, quite without his permission. �I think I saw a ghost, Mr. Friend.�\r      \r      Barty walked, light as a feather. When he had entered the office of Mr. Friend, he had brought so much stress and worry. Now, leaving, he felt as though everything would be okay.\r      �Thanks, Mr. Friend,� Barty told the man as he left.\r      The school counselor peered over his glasses with a proud expression. �You�re doing great, Barty. Stay focused on the things that matter.�\r      Barty walked away, feeling as though he could handle anything that happened to him. He carried this confidence through the rest of his classes. Being smirked at did not bother him as much. Kelly tried to get under his skin later in the day, but he merely smiled at her and walked away. �I�ll work on the tux as soon as I get home,� he assured her. She did not know what to say.\r      Barty could see the ghost in the hall situation in a whole new light. He had allowed the stress of school, the absence of his father, and the pressure of his friends to build up. Then, when he saw the contents of the locker, it exploded. He had convinced himself that he saw a girl glow and vanish. A panic attack will do that to you, he reassured himself.\r      When he caught up with Mildred, she started with the issue of the locker.\r      �Are you ready?� she began.\r      �Ready for what?� Barty replied.\r      �To go look at the yearbook!�\r      He looked into her face, trying to think of the right words to say. �I�m okay, now, Mildred. We don�t have to.�\r      She frowned at him, in shock. �What do you mean? We planned this together. Why not just go look?�\r      �Mildred,� he began, �What�s the point? There�s a memorial in a locker. What�s that supposed to mean? I had a panic attack.�\r      Her mouth hung open. �What?� he asked.\r      �What�s wrong with you?� She looked almost angry.\r      Exactly what Mr. Friend warned me about, Barty thought. �Nothing�s wrong with me! I feel good! Better than I have in weeks, actually.�\r      She squinted her eyes at him. �You look good, Barty. Did your session with Mr. Friend go well?�\r      Barty smiled cheerfully. �Very well.�\r      �So, I guess he�s the one that helped you feel better.� Her tone almost sounded accusatory, threatened.\r      �He helped,� Barty felt tense. Why did this bother her? �We just talked.�\r      �What did you talk about?�\r      He straightened up. �Nothing! We just talk about how stressed I�ve been.�\r      �You told him about the ghost?�\r      �There is no ghost, Mildred!� Barty had had enough. �There is another explanation. We just need to find it.�\r      She inhaled, closing her eyes. �I get that, Barty. I�m sorry.�\r      �It�s okay,� he assured her. He did not want to hurt her feelings.\r      �I know it�s been stressful,� she said this in a caring tone. �I guess I was a little disappointed because I thought we would find clues in the locker somewhere. Maybe not of a ghost, but something else. I mean, think about it.�\r      Barty had indeed thought about it. If someone had put on a show for them, then the locker would have been part of the plan. �You�re right.� He had few words to say about it. She had won.\r      Her face had changed into a satisfied smile. �Well, stop wasting time, you idiot!� She grabbed him by the arm and pulled him in the direction of the Hell Hall. They sped walk toward Hall C, Barty stumbling as he tried to slow her down.\r      Then, together they crossed the red barrier into the light of the familiar corridor. Barty felt as though he could see it in a new light. Nothing felt out of the ordinary. This was just a normal hallway.\r      �There it is!� Mildred spoke, excited. �Wait!� She fumbled her backpack, swinging it around. Unzipping the bag, she reached inside and spoke. �I got these for us. I stole them from my foster dad�s hurricane kit.� She pulled out two long black flashlights and handed one to Barty. �We can�t detect anything without flashlights, right?� She turned hers on and shone the light up her face. She looked like a kid getting ready to tell a scary story. \r      They both advanced, shining lights in the dusty corners of the corridor for fun. When they reached the locker, Barty noticed the lock had been removed. He shone his light on the latch. �It�s gone.�\r      �What�s gone?� Mildred replied.\r      �The lock.�\r      They gathered closer, afraid of what they might find when they opened the locker. If the lock had been taken, what else had been?\r      �If it was a memorial,� Mildred said. �It should still be there.�\r      Barty reached for the latch, the movement stretching on forever. He felt the cold of the steel latch as he pulled back the door. Mildren pointed her light into the space, studying the pictures and memorabilia, pausing briefly over a handmade bracelet that had the letters �MF?GS� in plastic beads. A dead flower petal dropped from the bottom of the locker onto the tiled floor.\r      �Is this what you remember?� Mildred scanned the flowers and pictures.\r      �Almost.� He gripped his flashlight tighter as he drowned the shelf of books in white LED light. Everything had been untouched with the exception of one item.\r      �What?� Mildred begged.\r      Barty closed his eyes, and pinched the space underneath his eyebrow. �Everything is the same, Mildred,� he started. �But the yearbook.�\r      Someone had stolen it.",

        "text": "CHAPTER SIX\rMont Linola Jr. High School, 1999\r      Someone took the yearbook. Barty started a new page in his notebook. This meant he needed a space to write out his thoughts. He scratched his head with his pencil. He had learned not to use ink. Ink meant permanent. Of course, he could have written more. Whatever Laurie had to do with this scheme involved Preston and Beau. It has to be connected, he thought.\r      �Mildred.� Barty decided to ask her the question that had been burning in his mind. The following morning, before classes began, he made his move. �What were you doing, tailing Preston and Beau?�\r      She took a moment to collect her thoughts before speaking. Barty suspected that she might have a lot to say. \r      �At first, I was looking out for Gabe. I met Laurie in the Hell Hall, same as you. But she seemed� weird at first. I thought she must have been hiding there or something. But we started talking about people at school, and people she hated. She mentioned she had a brother that went here. She said that Beau Adams had been following him.�\r      Barty noted that nothing this far seemed different from his own experience. �What did you say to that?�\r      �I said that I knew Beau Adams was a big bully. But she told me that he actually tripped him on the bus and broke his leg.�\r      Barty felt his eyebrows come together in rage. He knew Beau could do something like this. �What did the driver do?� he asked.\r      �Nothing. Or that�s what she said. I offered to keep an eye out for him. That�s when I realized something weird going on. Beau was psycho, like, stalkerish. He would follow Gabe, and ask questions about where he was going. Every spare second, it seemed like he was on him.�\r      �Why?� Barty thought out loud. �That�s some odd behavior. Do you think Kelly knew any of this?�\r      �I don�t think they were that close at all.� She paused to think. �I mean, maybe. Didn�t you say that she threatened you? Like she knew something you didn�t want her to know?�\r      Barty squirmed thinking about this. He remembered too well. �Yes, but I don�t know what that would have to do with Gabe.�\r      �I asked around a little,� Mildred continued. �Some teacher was giving him money. He always had cash on him. But if that was true, it had to be outside of school. And once I found him snooping around in the records room. As far as what him and Preston were up to, I think they must have been in on it somehow. It looked like they were trying to draw me out when they pulled out the knife. But I have no idea how it all fits together.�\r      Barty had to think about this information. He made a few more notes in his notebook.\r      �Mildred, you already know this,� he looked around at a few students whispering across the hall. �I think we need to be careful about who we share with. We need to lay low.�\r      Mildred closed the locker she had been going through, a little too loudly.\r      �Who are you talking to, Barty?� Sarcasm oozed from her words. �Gonna tell Kelly?�\r      Kelly, Barty remembered. How could he have forgotten?\r      Mildred handed him a paper, and his mouth hung open. The school paper had used a picture of Barty and Kelly on the front page. It read �Barkelly? More like �Barfamily�� The boy marveled at Mildred�s ingenuity. �How?� He stared at the page, wondering how the photo had been taken.\r      The news spread like a weed. In History, Barty�s teacher had planned a period of class presentations. A boy named Roy Burkley had a presentation on prominent families in the town of Mont Linola. He had prepared a large poster board with historic pictures of families related to a few prominent students. Where two branches connected, a picture of Barty and a picture of Kelly had been glued in place.\r      One student leaned back in his chair, a look of skepticism on his face. �How did you find this information?�\r      Roy Burkley responded, �I got my information from the Mont Linola Historic Preservation Society.� He even had official emails printed out that confirmed his findings.\r\t�Barty,� said Mr. Hartley, the History teacher. �You and Kelly Prescott could be cousins!� The other students in the class traded whispers, bouncing their eyes from him to their friends.\r      Barty marveled at Mildred�s ingenuity. When Barty made his way to Biology, he noted the students all reading the school paper. They should give her a writing credit, he remarked to himself. Their plan was working.\r\tIn Biology, Mrs. Ravine discussed the dangers of inbreeding. A clownish boy raised his hand and asked, �Mrs. Ravine, if Barty and Kelly turn out to be cousins, what would happen to their kids?�\r      �Well, certainly they couldn�t be too related.� She looked over her glasses at Barty, who shrunk lower in his chair. �I�m sure your children would be beautiful, Mr. Beauregard.� \r      Muffled chuckles from students rumbled in the room. Momentarily, life had left his body. What was I thinking, he pondered. He wanted to get out of his date with Kelly, but did he really think this a good idea?\r      After the third period, Kelly sprang upon him in the hall. �BARTY!� She stomped like a rhinoceros toward her prey. �Have you heard the rumors?�\r      �What rumors?� He scratched his arm, appearing aloof and cool.\r�The rumors that WE�RE COUSINS! You wouldn�t have something to do with this?� He smiled, feeling satisfied. �You think I like the idea that I�m taking my cousin to the school dance?�\r      Her face looked blood red. She stomped her foot on the ground, fists at her side. �If I find out that you�re behind this, I�ll� I�ll�� Barty could have bitten her finger, now pointed to his nose.\r      �You�ll what?� Barty interrupted. �Roy Burkley researched this. Talk to him about it.�\r      With nothing more to say, she marched away, her band of Preppy Pinks following faithfully behind.\r      At lunch, Barty intentionally sought to sit with Kelly.\r      �What are you doing?� She begged, looking like she had seen a ghost. Barty stood over her, holding a tray in his hands.\r      �I just wanted to eat lunch with you, Pookie.� He stole a glance across the cafeteria at Mildred, sitting alone. She returned the look, enjoying the presentation.\r      �You really don�t have to��\r      �I insist,� Barty butt in. �We�re going to be closer when we dance, you know. No need to be afraid of me.� For a moment, she looked frightened. Then, Barty caught a flash of malice in her eyes. He took a seat opposite her, the Preppy Pinks unzipping to let him in.\r      �Oh, but of course,� she returned. �I�ll play along. I�m not afraid of a little attention.�\r      �Of course not,� Barty parried. �You love attention, don�t you?�\r      She looked almost evil. �Not as much as I love power, Barty. And I think I have a little more than you.�\r      Barty took a bit of red beans and rice, the lunch special. It tasted better than normal. Then, after swallowing, he spoke again. �It must run in the family.�\r      \r      During his free period, he spent time in the library. He did not want to return to the Hell Hall quite yet. The corridor had come with a few surprises lately, but he felt he could trust the librarian to keep the stillness of the room. He sat at the same desk that Kelly had earlier put her hands on. He shuddered, thinking back on that afternoon.\r      This day, he had used the computer to find books that might be helpful to his investigation. He searched �Mont Linola,� hoping to find books of local lore and history. He found none. Typical, he thought. Mont Linola had a population of about eleven thousand. Even though its roots stretched back a few hundred years, Mont Linola simply existed.\r      He could not help indulge his more interesting thoughts. He searched for �ghosts� and looked through the lengthy search results. One particular book, Help! My Friend is Dead: Ghosts and How to Talk to Them, seemed interesting. The author went by the name �Adaline Garbotholow,� an unusual combination of letters. Barty clicked the link on the title and glanced through the author information.\r      \rAdaline Garbotholow shares her unique perspective as one who has crossed over and lived to tell the tale. A mystic in the town of Mont Linola, she leads the community in finding peace with their departed loved ones. She has communed with the dead, dined with the departed, and made deals with the devil.\r\r      He scoffed at the description. �How ridiculous,� he said out loud. His voice had carried in the silent library. Barty quickly looked around, hoping to not have disturbed anyone, but he found himself alone.\r      He paused to think. Theoretically, he could meet Adaline Garbotholow if he ever had questions. He remembered the words Susan, the antique shop owner, had told him. Someone in the area did that sort of thing. He wondered whether this was Adaline Garbotholow. He could easily verify the information. If anything, he thought, I could learn something about local spiritual traditions.\r      After attempting to find the book himself, he discovered it was gone from the shelf. He made his way to the librarian�s desk, where a small, greying lady in a floral blouse sat reading her computer screen.\r      �This book is actually checked out right now,� she informed him.\r      �How long will it be out?� \r      She scrolled on her mouse wheel. �It should be returned by Friday. Hopefully the boy returns it on time.�\r      Barty gathered his things to leave. But then, he remembered a book that he could potentially view in the library. The Yearbook. He returned to the librarian�s desk to ask again for help.\r      He cleared his throat to indicate his presence. Noticing him standing there, she looked over her glasses and acknowledged him. �Do you need something else?�\r      �Yes. Do you have old yearbooks here?�\r      �Yes, we do actually,� she replied. Then she raised a boney finger, adorned with a large jeweled ring, and pointed at a line of books atop a short bookshelf. Barty followed her direction hopefully.\r      �They will be in the non-fiction section on top of that shelf. But they aren�t for lending, so you will have to leave them here.� Barty agreed, and thanked her again. Then, he made his way to the corner of the room that she had indicated.\r      Books lined the shirt shelf that divided the seating sections from the back wall of books. He found a set of books that matched. The first spine read, �Mont Linola Junior High School, 1999.� He looked at the following book in line, but noticed it jumped from 1999 to 2001. Distressed, he fingered through the entire collection looking for the missing edition. Double checking, he realized the yearbook did not reside there.\r      He quickly walked through the library, looking at the tables and seating sections. He glanced at the various shelves throughout the room, hoping to see the navy blue binding and gold letters standing out among the shades of colors. But no matter how many looks from the librarian he solicited, he could not find the missing book.\r      Frustrated and defeated, he grabbed the prior yearbook and brought it to his desk. As he thumbed through the pages, he caught the smell of stale paper. In a few places, students had defaced the library copy. When he had gone through all of the class rosters, he frowned. Melora Freedman was not in the yearbook at all. She must not have been at the school this year, he reasoned. Then, he started over and began looking again. He stopped turning when he saw a face he recognized.\r      �Mr. Friend,� he quietly uttered. He had stopped at a class roster page. �Justin Friend.� His face looked softer and his hair thicker. He wore wireframe aviator glasses. The young Friend�s smile seemed as large as the elder Friend's. But, somehow, the photo showed a version that seemed more genuine, unphased by the trials of time.\r      Barty turned through the pages to highlights that featured candid pictures taken of students. He stopped again, seeing another familiar face. �Dad!� The word leapt out of his mouth. On the page, Barty saw a picture of Justin Friend and his father, Andrew Beauregard, his arm around Friend�s neck. They wore gym clothes, tank tops and long basketball shorts. In the background, kids stood on the school basketball court.\r      �What�s this,� Barty whispered, conscious not to talk too loudly. He leaned closer to the page, trying to focus his eyes in the fading glow from the skylight above him. �I�ve seen this boy.� In the corner of the photo, a person walked in the background.\r      He closed the book. Something had shuffled in the darkness of the library, largely lit by skylights around the room. The lights now seemed dark and faded, like the sky had become grey. The noise, whatever had made it, felt like a flash of sound. The sudden movement had startled him.\r      He looked around the room for the librarian, but she had gone. �Miss Turnbuckle?� He quietly called her name out, hoping she had gone to the other side of a bookshelf.\r      He stood, cautious and careful, and walked around the desk. He remembered feeling trapped when Kelly had cornered him. Whatever happened, he did not want to feel that way again. Then, leaving the book on the desk, he stepped outside of his safespace into the darkness. \r      Don�t leave the light, boy. A sinister voice trailed in the room, doubled by the faint echoes of the emptiness. It pierced the silence like a serrated blade, scratching his ears.\r      �Who�s there?� He called louder now, feeling the urgency of his heartbeat prodding him on. He stepped toward the aisles of bookshelves, hoping to see a familiar face. Even Kelly would be great, he thought to himself. As he leapt around the corner, he caught a flash of green cloth fade around the corner.\r      A shrill cackle echoed in the room. Where had the librarian gone? Certainly, she would correct this disturbance if she heard it. \r      She�s dead, you know. Again, loud in his ears, reminding him of Laurie�s haunting presence. And daddy�s never coming back!\r      �Who are you?!� He yelled now, unafraid of being scolded by the librarian. He jerked around, thinking that moving quickly might detect the presence. He hustled back to the place where his desk had been, now fully aware of the sinister feeling in the room. The desk sat undisturbed, unlike himself.\r      But the pages of the yearbook now flew open and flipped on their own, as if a wind had come upon them. They stopped on a page in the middle. Slowly approaching, he looked into the book, unsure of what he would find.\r      Dead� dead� dead� The voice trailed, laughing in the pauses. In red ink, the words appeared on the page, over a photo of a student. Barty knew her face in an instant, by the familiar brown eyes of a girl with light brown skin. She smiled in her portrait, as the words scribbled on her face. The name underneath, �Tula Ordogne,� Barty�s mother.\r      Without any kind of warning, cold, thin hands wrapped around Barty�s neck from behind, squeezing tightly, cutting off his breath. He tried to scream, but found that no noise came from his lungs. The hands, with long, claw-like nails, cast him to the carpeted, blue floor. Then, she leapt upon him, and he fully saw her.\r      With eyes, yellow and bloodshot, the skeletal form of a woman hung over him, an old weathered dress, like a nightgown, draped over her lifeless body. Her hair, white and thin, floated in the still air of the room. She resembled a dead body, ressurected to torment the living.\r      She had him pinned down, her nails digging into his wrists. He breathed quickly, trying to move, but the weight of her thin body felt heavy. She spoke directly to him now, close to his face. When her mouth opened, her teeth looked jagged, as if shaved down to sharp stumps. �You�re gonna die, too.� Her breath reeked, like alcohol mixed with bad garlic. �You better run, Barty.� She slapped his face, hard and heavy. Searing, hot pain fill his head. \r      With Barty�s arm free from her slapping hand, he shoved her, feeling the thin, bony form of her shoulder. She toppled to the side, allowing him to maneuver. As he turned and began to rise, her hands again grabbed his feet. He fell once more. She had the grip of a bodybuilder, fresh from training.\r      �You can�t get away from me, boy!� She threw her head back and laughed. He shook his legs, trying to kick her off, but she held fast. �You are gonna die!� She laughed again, and his head began spinning. Then, she pulled his pant leg up, revealing white, tender flesh. She threw her mouth on the back of his leg and bit hard. He kicked and yelled, but she had too much strength. The teeth sank into his skin, creating tears that bled. He reached up, and found that he could reach the small chair that he had sat in. With all of his might, he swung it over his head and crashed it into her head.\r      She screamed, �Aggggghhhh! How dare you!� as she coiled on the ground in pain.\r      He ran, as fast as he could to the door, only to find that it had been locked from the inside. He desperately searched for a key or a latch, but none existed. Her hands grabbed his shoulders again, and he nearly punched her, but she pushed hin head into the wood of the door, hard. The pain in his head surfaced again. He closed his eyes, thinking, wake up Barty! Wake up! She isn�t real! This is a dream! He tried to open them again, but he could not. Darkness had engulfed him.\r      \r      Barty awoke, his head on the yearbook. Drool had started dripping down his chin onto the pages. He quickly wiped it away and looked up.\r      �Wake up, Barty,� the librarian spoke harshly, hovering over his half awake form. �Get to class, young man.� The librarian appeared normal, but scolding. She had that look he had grown used to, menacing in her own way. But he appreciated seeing her menacing face rather than the face of the woman.\r      �Yes, ma�am,� he replied, glazing quickly at the yearbook. The page had indeed been turned to the photo of his mother, but the red words had vanished. He could feel pain in his head and in his leg where the ghost had bit him. He dared not look during that moment, with the librarian hovering over him. Even if the hag had gone, even if the words had vanished, he still felt the pain. He still knew the truth of the red ink. His mother, indeed, was dead.\r      \r      �It�s still there,� Barty said, a tinge of fright in his voice. He and Mildred had been looking at his leg. There, in the middle of his calf, a circle of cuts had bled all over his skin. �I need to get this treated.�\r      �Will you go to Miss Gerard?� she asked. \r      �No!� he immediately barked. �I don�t want anyone at the school asking questions.�\r      Mildred understood immediately. �Ok, I�ll be right back.� She left him there, in an abandoned restroom. Then after what felt like a lifetime, she returned holding a bottle of alcohol and bandages.\r      �Wow, that�s freaking creepy,� Mildred said with dark fascination. She had patched him up, and they now walked to the bus line. Barty tried hard not to limp, but every step sent pain to his injury. Blood had stained his pants, but he hoped that it could pass for mud. They took their time, allowing students to fly past them.\r      �Dead, dead, dead�� she muttered, looking forward blankly. �Three 'dead�s� Maybe it represents three dead people.�\r      Barty did not want to think about it. But, he knew she could be right. �Who could they be?�\r      �Well, obviously your mother.� Barty frowned. Even though he knew this to be true, somehow the words so casually thrown out seemed to cut.\r      �Obviously,� he repeated.\r      �Sorry, I didn�t mean to��\r      �It�s fine. Continue,� he cut in to stop her sympathizing.\r      �Well your mom, Melora, and maybe�� she hesitated.\r      �What?� Barty prodded. He did not enjoy the feeling that something waited on the other side of her pause.\r      �Your dad?�\r      Barty glanced at her, confused. �My dad? Why my dad? Do you think something is going to happen to him?�\r      Mildred did not speak. She only moved with him, exiting the school. They noticed Kelly waiting on the sidewalk. She looked at them, then quickly averted her eyes.\r      The familiar Black sports car had hesitated at the entrance of the school pick-up line. Then, as if it had snapped back to life, it revved its engine, and sped to the front of the line.\r      Kelly ripped the door open with force, trying to escape the eyes of her peers as fast as possible. But as she sat, the window rolled down, revealing her covering her face. An adult woman with huge black sunglasses leaned over here and yelled, �Barty Beauregard!�\r      Kelly mouthed at her mother, �stop!� But the woman seemed not to hear between the loud smacks of her chewing gum. Her lips looked blood red with deep lipstick, and her bright, bleached blonde hair had been half tied up.\r      �Barty! Come here, sweetheart!� Her voice, with a distinct southern accent, drew the eyes of the students in the vicinity.\r      Barty, too, felt embarrassed at the attention. He looked at Mildred, who only smiled, and then he obediently walked to the car. As he approached, Kelly shrunk deeper into the tan, leather interior, dying from embarrassment. She glared at Barty. He felt sure that she intended to murder him with her look.\r      Her mother continued. �I�m so excited that you are taking my sweet Kelly Nelly to the dance! And to think, you�re cousins!�\r      �Kelly Nelly?� Barty could not help but chuckle to himself. \r      �It�s just a little pet name, of course,� she continued. �You two are going to remember this night for the rest of your lives! I wish my cousin had the heart to take me to the dance, but instead, I got stuck with that meaty hunk of a boy, Kieth Dobson.� \r      �Mom!� Kelly demanded.\r      The woman laughed. �Stop, Kelly! We�re family!� Then, she reached into her purse and pulled out an envelope that had Barty�s name scribbled across the front.\r      �This summer, we�re having a family reunion. That�s got all the information you need on it, right there.�\r      �Thanks, Mrs. Prescott,� Barty replied, feeling truly thankful. �I�ll see if I can go.�\r      Kelly again begged her mom to leave, but the woman only shushed her, saying something about patience. Then, she turned again to Barty.\r      �Look, I know things are weird right now with your dad gone and all�� Her voice trailed momentarily. Then she bounced back as if she forgot something mid sentence. �Well, we can pick you up of course. And if you need anything, call me. My number�s in there. Family�s gotta look out for each other, you know?� Barty agreed, although the concept of family felt unfamiliar to him. As she rolled her window up, they traded goodbyes. The engine roared again as they sped off. Barty glanced at Kelly, mouthing some rather bad words at him through the dark tinted window.\r      Turning around, Barty saw that Mildred had gone. He felt the embossed post office stamp on the white, textured envelope. He craved Mildred�s reaction for a moment, then walked to his place on the sidewalk. He had not thought about his mother for some time, but his vision of the yearbook had stirred some vague feelings of loss within him. Hearing Kelly�s mother offer kindness to him, the way that a mother does, had reminded him. My mother is dead, after all. Dead� dead�\r      Dead.",

        "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN\rThe Geezerly Ghosts\r      �Absolutely NOT! Why would I give you access to Melora�s file?� Miss White bellowed, standing behind the front desk in the school lobby. She towered over the two students, who looked up in fear. She yelled to the janitor, mopping up a spill behind Barty and Mildred, �Jeff, wanna take a look at Barty�s file? I�ve got his address and disciplinary records right here.�\r      �I�m good,� the janitor replied. He did not even stop mopping to look.\r      �Are you sure?� she continued, angrily mocking the request. �Mildred here�s got some juicy details in hers. I�m ready and willing to hand out confidential documents to just anybody!�\r      �Nope. I�m fine,� the janitor replied, a low gravelly voice.\r      She stopped shouting and looked back down at Barty and Mildred. Smiling, looking sweet and genuine, she asked, �Now, can I help you two with anything else?�\r      �No, ma�am,� they both said together.\r      Defeated, they marched back to their home room to regroup. They had inquired from Miss White, the school administrator, whether they could read Melora�s file. They hoped to find something that could help them understand what her life had been life at Mont Linola Junior High. Even if they could find information about her parents, they could cross reference Gabe De Vera�s records and settle the question of their relationship. �I can get the records,� Mildred reassured Barty.\r      �Don�t get caught,� he said. He knew she could do it. How, he did not know. She had proven to be a capable companion throughout their mischief. Indeed, the rumors proved true. She could get information. When asked about how, she usually said something like, �I just know how to blend in.� Barty knew she could do this. She had popped up behind him so many times that he had come to expect it. Still, so much about her remained a mystery to him.\r      The following day, as they convened in the library, she produced two stacks of papers, �photocopied on the school�s copy machine,� she noted. \r      The library had been deserted. Most students, and indeed many of the teachers, used the lunch hour to eat. Barty and Mildred, however, used the hour to steal away to the abandoned book sanctuary to debrief. He wanted to show her the yearbook from the year 1999. Barty almost suggested that Mildred steal the yearbook away from the library altogether. After his last nap session in the room, he did not fully desire to return to the library anytime soon.\r      �I just got her full file, not Gabe�s,� Mildred noted.\r      �Obviously,� Barty replied. It would have been invasive to look through his complete file. \r      �I do have his class schedule, and family information.� She pushed a printed page toward Barty. �If we need to find him, it should be easy.�\r      Barty immediately noted a difference in style between Melora�s file and Gabe�s. Her�s had largely been handwritten on a generic photocopied form. The top page, although copied, still carried the impressions of coffee cup rings and oily thumbprints of the originals. Gabe�s looked newly printed from a database software, with printed page numbers at the bottom.\r      Barty quickly surveyed the family information page of Melora�s. �Mother, Theresa Freedman. Father, Jack Freedman.�\r      Mildred lifted the page with Gabe�s family information. �Mother, Michelle De Vera. Father, N.A.� She frowned. �In the notes, there�s no information.� \r      �But at least we know Melora�s mother.� Barty swapped the pages of her file around, combing for useful information. �She was on the swim team. Would there be a photo of the team that year?�\r      �We could check,� Mildred replied. \r      Barty glared down at the pages. �There�s not a lot here. Very few notes, no disciplinary records. In the guidance counselor section, it says �visited biweekly, dealing with stress.��\r      Mildred looked at the pages flipping in his hands. �Wouldn�t a school counselor have taken more notes? What does it say about her death?�\r      Barty turned to the first page, where someone had written in the top margins. �Student deceased, October 1st, 2000. Accidental drowning. Counseling offered to the student body.�\r      �Accidental.� Mildred repeated.\r      Barty bit his lip. Something felt off. At first glance, they could not find a connection between the boy and Melora. She had been seeing the school counselor, and Barty thought about the computer that Mr. Friend used to take notes during their session. He had been so thorough, often recalling phrases Barty had used haphazardly.\r      �Let me see Melora�s file again,� Barty commanded.\r      Mildred complied. Then, Barty began turning through the pages again, eyeing them carefully. �Do you see this?�\r      �It�s the counseling notes page,� Mildred answered. �What about it?�\r      �It�s too clean,� Barty noted. �Look at the other pages. People obviously handled these. This one� This one looks too new.�\r      She took the pages from him and observed for herself. �Well, maybe�� She stuck her tongue out in concentration. �You�re right.�\r      �And the font looks different,� Barty grabbed a magnifying glass that Mildred had brought. He held the two pages under the glass. Then, he pointed to the counseling page. �Look, this font is thicker, cleaner. It doesn�t have those hooks on the letter.�\r      Mildred, impressed, agreed. �Seraphs. That�s what they�re called. The other pages use a seraph font.�\r      �Someone printed this recently,� Barty concluded. �To me, this confirms what we knew.�\r      She studied his face. �Someone is trying to hide something about Melora�s death.�\r      They opened the yearbook in front of them and turned to the photo of Andrew Beauregard and Justin Friend. Mildred produced a magnifying glass and held it in the corner of the photo. Barty had pointed out a dark face in the background that he had spied before.\r      Under the power of the glass, the face became clearer. A boy, tall and dark, stood on the court, barely making it into the photo. Still too small to see the details of his face, something about his stance made Barty feel like he had seen him before.\r      �You see him?� Barty asked. �Does he seem familiar to you?�\r      �Yes, he does,� she returned. �I can�t put my finger on where, though. Maybe he�s related to one of our classmates. Like, someone�s dad or something. I�m sure it wasn�t just your parents that went to Mont Linola when they were kids.�\r      Barty thought about this for a moment. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his cellphone. He took a picture of the photograph for later. �Maybe I can do a reverse image search.�\r      Mildred blinked at him. �What�s that?�\r      �On the internet. I�ll use a photo as a search term, instead of a word.� He thought that perhaps Mildred did not have the technological proficiency that he might have assumed. After all, she did not own a cell phone.\r      �That�s amazing�� her eyes drifted off, as if in thought.\r      �Don�t feel bad, honey!� Someone shouted from across the room. �Just because he�s a computer whiz doesn�t mean he�s smart!�\r      Another person, with an old southern accent added, �My niece, now she�s smart. She can find a tv show by talking into the remote. I don�t know how they do it. The world�s a different place these days.�\r      Barty and Mildred both turned to look. Across the library, a small group of six students had formed, sitting at a table. Some reclined, while others read books. Two of them leaned over a chessboard, in deep thought. Barty wondered why the librarian, in an adjoined office, had not come out to scold them for their loud shouting. Apparent rulebreakers, these students had not come to school in dress code. They wore pleated pants and suspenders, dresses, and old hats.\r      Mildred�s face beamed for a moment. �Kenny! Ellis! Where have you been?�\r      Kenny? Ellis? Barty had been under the impression that she did not have many friends. Who were these people?\r      She walked to where the group sat, Barty trailing behind. The librarian poked her head out of her office. She looked to where Mildred stood and quietly spoke, �Mildred! Watch your volume or you�ll have to leave.�\r      Mildred agreed to keep quiet, then turned to greet her friends. They stood up when she came to the table and bowed slightly. One removed his hat as she sat.\r      �This is Barty, everyone,� she said, holding her hand toward the boy.\r      He smiled awkwardly and said �hello.�\r      The boy named Kenny reached out to shake his hand. Barty hesitated for a moment, then took it. The hand felt like ice.\r      �I�m Kenny Cantrelle. This is Ellis, Jill, Agatha, Leo, and Thomas.� As he said each of their names, he indicated with his hand the person whose name he spoke. In turn, they smiled and nodded. Agatha said, �How do you do?�\r      �I�m okay,� Barty replied. His thoughts ran in circles. He loathed meeting people. Especially students that seemed so� odd. Mildred pulled out a chair around the conjoined desks and sat with ease. �Guys, have you ever seen these people?� She laid the yearbook out on the table. All of the friends gathered around it, pushing and shoving to look.\r      One girl, Agatha, spotted the man in the background immediately. �I see this is after they let all the blacks��\r      �I will punch you in the nose, Agatha.� Jill interrupted her immediately.\r      Agatha lunged back. �I just noticed! I have no problem with them at all! My best friend was a�� The other at the table looked at her with annoyed facial expressions. �I can see my opinion is not wanted.� She did not say more.\r      Barty could not help analyzing their interactions, their mannerisms, and their vocal oddities. Sometimes, nerds gather to play pretend as knights or wizards. Perhaps this group of students gathered to play old people at a coffee shop.\r      �I�ve seen the guy in the background.� Ellis spoke. �He�s been hanging around the school lately.�\r      Barty and Mildred traded looks. �That�s right,� said Barty. �He has.�\r      �The other day, he was outside, watching us board,� Mildred replied. �He gave me the creeps.�\r      �And he should!� said Thomas. �Fella like that can only mean trouble.�\r      �Fella like that?� Kenny repeated. �You and Agatha need to remember what year it is and watch what you say.�\r      Kenny raised his hands defensively. �I didn�t mean anything by it! Not like I called him a name! I�m just saying. A grown adult hanging out by a school��\r      �Multiple times, mind you!� Agatha came to his support. �In my day, we would have taken care of that problem.�\r      �In your day? Don�t get me started,� Jill cut in. �I know a few people that remember your day! They�re still around, you know. Maybe you outta meet them.�\r      Agatha shrank in her chair, muttering.\r      �Excuse me,� Barty interjected. �Have you noticed anything else? Do you know his name?�\r      The friends took turns looking at each other, until Leo finally spoke. �Why do you need the name?� He sounded authoritative and serious, like he had seen a few things in his life.\r      Barty thought for a moment, formulating a sentence. Mildred looked ready to speak, but watched him carefully, waiting for permission. He gave her a look that communicated �just wait a second.�\r      He cleared his throat, and said, �We�re just wondering. That�s my dad in the picture. Maybe they knew each other.� \r      �Then why don�t you ask your dad, himself?� Leo replied.\r      Barty swallowed. If only he could. �He�s not around,� Barty replied.\r      �Typical,� Leo spoke. �These days, there�s never parents. Always kids bouncing around from home to home. Getting into trouble. Doing the drugs!�\r      Mildred spoke again. �I met a girl in the Hell Hall, but I haven�t seen her in a while. Maybe you have.�\r      �What�s she look like?� Jill asked.\r      Barty thought about how to describe her. A description could easily describe any other girl at the school. He thought for a moment, then gave it his best shot. �Well, she wears a jacket. A letterman. Every time I talked to her, at least. She says she�s related to Gabe De Vera. Does that ring a bell?�\r      �I know her,� said Leo. �She�s trouble. Aloof-like. She�s not like us.�\r      �What do you mean?� Barty asked.\r      �Some people don�t belong here,� said Agatha. �And I don�t mean �cause of skin color or nothin�. Some people are better off moving on. Hanging around does something to you.�\r      They sat silent for a moment. The light above their head faded a little and Barty briefly thought about his dream in the library. �Are you ghosts?� he asked, as bluntly as ordering a hot dog. Still, the question surprised him. A few weeks earlier, and he would never have given the thought attention.\r      Kenny stood, silently staring at him. �If we were ghosts,� he said in a low voice. �How could you see us?�\r      �I don�t know,� Barty replied.\r      He peeked over the bookshelf at Miss Turnbuckle perusing her computer. When he looked up at her, she glanced back at him over her stereotypical librarian glasses. Damn it, Barty thought. He had clearly caught her attention. \r\tShe got up and began walking to the table where they had been speaking. Barty knew immediately that their volume had gotten out of hand. \r      �Can I help you two find something?� She asked suspiciously. Her body language resembled a police officer, hoping to catch a criminal in the act.\r\t�No, I think we found what we�re looking for,� Barty responded, flat and lifeless. He noticed she had only counted the two of them, or, at least, she only had a problem with two.\r\tMildred opened an important looking book that one of the friends had been reading. �This is it,� she remarked.\r\tAgatha smiled sheepishly. �Eh, I�ve had a spot on my stomach for years, it seems.� The librarian ignored her. \r\tLeo responded to her quickly. �Nobody cares, Agatha.�\r\t�Remedies for Common Rashes and Infections?� questioned Miss Turnbuckle. �Got an infection, one of you?�\r      Barty and Mildred both turned to each other. Mildred�s mouth hung open in disgust. �Uh, yes. Not me�or Barty�my friend. She�s been bothered by this red, goopy spot on her belly.�\r\tThe Librarian winced. �Oh! Well, shouldn�t she see the doctor? Or even Nurse Gerard?�\r\tMildred hesitated, then spoke. �She�s afraid of medical personnel.�\r\tAgatha gaped at her. �I am not!�\r      The librarian eyed Mildred, squinting slightly. �And Mr. Beauregard knows this friend as well? He seems to be very interested in her fungal health.�\r      �I�m definitely not!� Barty burst. This solicited a smile from the librarian and laughter from the group of friends.\r      �Well, whatever you two need to look for, make sure it�s out in the light. I don�t need any more books disappearing from this library. Do you understand?�\r      The two students traded looks again, then they slowly nodded at her.\r      �I noticed that I couldn�t find a book the other day. The yearbook from 2000. Is that what you�re referring to?�\r      She gave him a stern, confused look, then turned on her heels to the shelf where Barty had found the yearbooks earlier. Barty followed, leaving Mildred�s mysterious friends murmuring and joking about Agatha�s rash.\r      Thumbing through the years, the librarian clucked with her tongue. �Oh! It looks like we have a few missing copies. Indeed, 2000 is missing.� She apologized. �You were looking to see your parents?�\r      Barty looked at her in shock, studying her face.\r      �Barty, I�ve been at this school for thirty years.� She smiled at him. �I knew your parents when they were your age. That�s better than a yearbook, I can tell you that.�\r      Barty felt excitement surge within him. She knew his parents. Who else might she have known? �Did you know Melora Freedman, by chance?�\r      She focused, thinking for a moment. �Is that the girl that went missing?�\r      �No, she didn�t go missing,� Mildred chimed in. She had slowly made her way to where the librarian and Barty stood. �She drowned in the school pool.�\r      �Oh! I remember now.�\r      Barty�s head spun with questions. �You mean a girl went missing?�\r      She frowned momentarily. �Mont Linola is an old school, Barty. Almost eighty years old. Things are bound to happen. Why, I remember a poor couple that died in a car accident, just before their school dance. It�s life, dear boy.�\r      �Or death, you mean,� Mildred corrected her.\r      �Touch�!� She smiled at Mildred�s play on words. Apparently even the librarian enjoyed a bit of dark humor. �But I do seem to remember that shortly before that awful accident in the pool, there was a girl that had gone missing. Everyone was so upset about it. Just up and ran away, or something like that.�\r      �You don�t remember her name?� Barty pressed.\r      The librarian started back to her desk. �I�m afraid I don�t, Mr. Beauregard.�\r      He frowned. Of course other kids went missing, he thought. For a moment, he pondered asking Mildred�s friends. He looked back at them. Kenny had been throwing his arms out wildly, doing an imitation of someone. The others were laughing, as if they cared little about the library's code of quiet. I wonder where they went? He thought to himself. He wondered how many students had died over the years. \r      Barty and Mildred, now loaded down with yet another question, left the library and headed toward the bus exit.\r      �Barty, what's up?� Mildred asked, noticing Barty had worn a serious face for all of five minutes.\r      �I think we should steal the yearbook,� he said quietly. �The �99 yearbook, I mean.�\r      She stopped, making him wait, and swung her bag around. After checking the hall, she opened the zipper.\r      �You didn�t!� Barty said, fully aware of the answer.\r      �I did.� She reached in and pulled up the corner of a large, navy blue book. Gold letters began to shimmer from the spine. Barty recognized it immediately. He surveyed her face momentarily. Then, he smiled. �Good move.�",

        "text": "CHAPTER EIGHT\r      On Monday, Mr. Friend greeted Barty in his usual, friendly way. But Barty sensed something in his demeanor had changed. He seemed nervous and fidgety. �Are you alright, Mr. Friend?�\r      �Yes, I�m fine, Barty!�\r      Barty did not believe him in the slightest. His hair seemed brushed, but slightly greasy as if he had not showered. Barty also noticed that his glasses had smudges on them, whereas normally, he polished them frequently. His fingernails had been peeled off, and his hands were dry and scaly. His shirt had more wrinkles than a used ball of aluminum foil. He hasn�t been taking care of himself, Barty suspected.\r      �You knew my dad, right?�\r      Mr. Friend shifted in his seat, almost spitting out his coffee.\r      �What�er, yes, yes I did,� the man responded, apparently surprised by the question. �How did you know?�\r      Barty sat straight up in his chair. He looked down to the right, thinking for a moment. Should I say? He debated if he should reveal where he had seen the picture of Mr. Friend and his father. If Mr. Friend had indeed stolen the yearbook, would he also go back for the 1999 edition?\r      �I heard from my dad that he knew you.� He lied.\r      Mr. Friend, or Justin, had a look of suspicion growing behind his glasses. �When was this?�\r      �A few months ago.� Barty lied again. He did not mention the yearbook or the happenings at school. \r      �That�s interesting, I think.� The man straightened himself in his seat. \r      �How so, Mr. Friend?� Barty�s eyebrows gave away his suspicion. �Is it odd that he would mention you? Did you two get along?�\r      �Oh yes! We got along swimmingly.� He smiled, reaching for trinkets on the desk. He seemed to fidget over this information, which made Barty want to pry further. �Did you know Melora Freedman?�\r      The man eyed him, stunned. �No. Who is that?�\r      Barty glared at him. Probably, if he could see in a mirror, he would have scared himself. Instinctively, he knew the counselor had lied.\r      �Barty,� the man continued. �We spoke about your mom in the past, and how you wish you could remember more about her. Have you spoken to your dad about this?�\r      Barty paused to think before responding. This is a game, I�m sure of it. Justin must have something to hide, but what? And why? Did his relationship to Barty�s dad have something to do with Melora Freedman�s death? Play along, Barty, he reminded himself.\r      �Yes,� Barty finally responded. �I think I�m beginning to remember some things.�\r      This prompted energy in the school counselor. He reacted, leaning forward slightly. �Like what, Barty?� Barty studied his movements, hoping to read something in his body language.\r      �Her smile. Her curly hair. The sound of her voice.�\r      �The sound of her voice? That�s amazing. How do you feel when you think about her?�\r      Barty sunk. His eyes drifted downward, staring into the universe. �I� uh� I feel lost.� He did not lie now. He could feel emotion rising to the surface.\r      A phone buzzed on the table. Barty�s eyes searched for the source of the noise. Mr. Friend quickly picked up the phone and flipped it open. �I�m so sorry, Barty. I have to take this. It�s very important.� He lifted the phone to his ear, and walked out the room. Barty tried to listen to what he had to say. When he closed the door, Barty heard the conversation as low rumbles. \r      He found it odd and inappropriate that Mr. Friend would take a call during their appointment. Unless, of course, the issue had to do with student safety. He could not hear the words clearly. The counselor�s voice carried in muffled sounds, indiscernible.\r      Barty looked around the room. Perhaps, if Mr. Friend had something going on, he could find something. But should he? What would Mildred do? He searched the desk with his eyes. The desk faced the wall, a laptop open to the left side so that only Mr. Friend could read the screen. The counselor used it to take notes occasionally. Barty shifted to his left in order to spy the screen. As he leaned, the screen came into view, quickly showing a locked sign-in screen. No luck.\r      His eyes moved from left to right, taking in the desk toys and coffee cup rings. Mr. Friend had bought a custom mousepad. It had been printed with a picture of Mr. Friend and his husband posing at a themepark. They looked incredibly happy. In their own awkward way, they matched each other's style, like a complementary set of salt and pepper shakers.\r      Above the desk, Mr. Friend hung a school calendar. The school dance had been circled on the fourth week. He had also scribbled notes and circled dates when he would be out. Nothing immediately seemed out of the ordinary, but Barty took a picture of the calendar with his phone to survey later. \r      The door handle wiggled, and Barty�s heart leapt. He thrust his phone under his thigh, just in case Mr. Friend had seen something. Barty could hear the voice clearer now, saying, �No, I know, Carrie. But we can discuss this outside of business hours. Okay? Oh. Really? Well, I�m going to let�� The voice trailed off as footsteps became more distant.\r      Barty peered under the desk. The garbage can seemed to glow from within it. Barty suspected this to be a fallen item, like a flashlight or a phone. His curiosity prodding him on, he knelt down to survey the contents of the can, almost hidden in shadow.\r      Barty reached into the garbage can carefully. He disliked garbage altogether. But this seemed worth the grime. The light seemed to be coming from some paper on the inside. Odd as this struck him, when he pulled the paper out into the light of the lamps in the room, the glowing ceased. He blinked. Had he imagined it?\r      The thick paper turned out to be a postcard. On the photoside, it had, printed on it, a photo of a Confederate Statue, a familiar sight in the City across the lake. On the letter side, someone had scrawled a note in nearly illegible hand. Barty could make out the signature just enough to read, �Remember, Steamy.�\r      His eyes glanced to the cloth of his pants, now illuminated with a soft white glow on the underside of the card. He flipped the card over again, but nothing happened. The glowing ceased. It must be too bright, he reasoned. And indeed, one could argue that the room, lit by lamps rather than overhead fixtures, could not be described as bright.\r      He raised his feet to the chair, bringing his knees close to his face. He cupped his hands around the photoside, providing a sample of darkness to the paper. Under his hands, some faint lettering appeared.\r      At that moment, the door ripped open, as Mr. Friend, flustered and elevated by the phone call, returned into the room. �I�m so sorry, Barty!�\r      Barty flattened his hands against the paper, hiding it. Simultaneously, his feet returned to the floor. Mr. Friend noticed this and frowned a small disappointed look. �Barty, maybe try not to put your feet on the chair. Leather, and all.�\r\tBarty apologized, then made an excuse. �Mr. Friend, it�s getting late.�\r\tThe counselor glanced at the time on his computer. Barty used this opportunity to shove the card into his pocket. Then, Mr. Friend, surprised at the time, replied, �Oh, sweet heavens. You�re right! Better head off to class.� He walked to the door and held it open for Barty.\r      �Once, again. I�m so sorry for the distraction.�\r\tBarty nodded silently, and exited, thinking more about the postcard than Mr. Friend�s lack of professionalism. He raced against the school bell, straight to a janitor�s closet. He jiggled the door handle and found it open. Once inside, he closed the door, suddenly wrapped in darkness. He pulled the postcard out, and indeed, letters shone brightly in the shadows of the room. Large letters had been etched into the glossy coating of the photo on the card. It seemed as though light pierced through the scratches in the paper, like a crack in a wall.\r     BARTY BEAUREGARD,\r     BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST. I�ll see you soon.\r- A REAL FRIEND\r\r\tThen, as if pulling him back to reality, the bell rang.\r      He stared down at the postcard, fascinated by the glowing light behind the lettering. A real friend? What could this mean? Barty felt certain that it could be a nod toward Mr. Friend himself. Perhaps the author of the note wanted to warn the boy of Justin Friend�s true motives. But on another, darker note, could it be a warning that Mildred could not be trusted?\r\tHe turned and reached for the handle of the closet in which he had hidden, still studying the postcard as he turned the latch. His wrist stopped turning as the handle hit an invisible wall. The door was locked from the outside. This can�t be, Bart thought momentarily, remembering the locked door in the library. He remembered the horrifying face of the woman. He tried again and again, shaking the handle with increasing desperation.\r\tHe banged his closed fists against the door, the postcard bouncing back and forth with each swing. �Hello!� he called. �Can someone help, please?� He continued swinging his hands against the golden, lacquered wood of the door. Why would someone design a door to lock like this? But no matter how hard he beat, no one came. He yelled, calling with as much volume as he could muster. �Someone, HELP!�\r\tNothing. No one came. He turned back around and leaned against the doorway, breathing hard. He was trapped.\r\tA few moments passed. He surveyed the card again, reading the letter, but it had been too dark. He turned the light on, hoping to make out the scrawled handwriting. He squinted and made out the first few lines. After a few tries, rereading and rewriting in his mind, he felt confident that he could understand the message.\r\t\rI�m coming soon. We need to talk in person. I have not found Bullet. Beware the boy.\r- Remember, Steamy\r      Barty bit his lip, carefully reading the words again and again. There must have been a clue hidden in the words. Bullet? Steamy? These must have been code words or nicknames. Unless, of course, someone had been shot. But who was the boy?\r      Barty fell backwards, the door he leaned on suddenly giving way. Now on the floor, he leaned against the legs of someone he did not yet know.\r      �What are you doing, hiding in the closet?� Barty sprang to his feet, hiding the postcard, and turned around. Before him stood Coach Grant, wearing the tiniest khaki shorts and yellow collared shirt. \r      �I got locked in. Someone pushed me in and closed the door.� Perhaps this lie would provoke empathy from the thin man. Certainly, he understood bullies.\r      The tall, awkward man bent over. Looking over his dark, aviator glasses, he eyed Barty. �What�s that in your pocket?�\r      �Why do you care? It�s none of your business.�\r      The coach leaned closer in, yet another person putting his face grossly close to Barty�s. The boy could almost see his reflection in the glass of his spectacles. �Give it to me.� His breath hit Barty in the face. It smelled like peppermint.\r      Barty felt as though he had no choice. He reached in and gave the man what he required. The coach looked at it, front and back, and opened the pages. �Your diary?� He chuckled to himself. �You should have just said so. But you had to act like a criminal.�\r      He handed the book back to Barty, who tucked it into his pants pocket. He relaxed, realizing the coach did not enjoy reading enough to actually look through the contents.\r      �I have to get to class, Coach Grant. May I go?�\r      The coach chewed gum and paused, clearly icing Barty.\r      �Principle Green wants you in his office,� he paused again. �I hope you aren�t in trouble.� He said this through a toothy grin.\r      The coach led Barty down the halls of the school toward the front lobby. The administrative wing branched off the main entrance, behind the front desk. Barty walked through the desk to the familiar waiting room, just outside of Principal Green�s office. He had been here several times before. Most recently, he waited here with Mildred after the bleacher incident.\r      Coach Grant knocked on the door, which swiftly opened. �Wait here for a minute,� he instructed Barty. The door closed, leaving Barty to his thoughts. Then after a moment, Coach Grant exited the room again, and nodded at the already anxious boy. �Have a good day, Mr. Beauregard.� Then, Barty entered the room slowly, surveying the situation.\r      �Barty! How wonderful it is to see you again!� A tall man in a grey suit stood to greet him.\r      �Mr. Webster,� Barty responded. Frank Webster held his hand out, but the boy did not accept it. By reputation, the man only came around bearing bad news.\r      �By wonderful, we mean unfortunate,� said his twin, wearing the same suit and red glasses.\r      �Mr. Webster,� Barty spoke to Loyd, always honest and tactless.\r      Mr. Green felt the need to greet Barty as well, so he chimed in from behind his desk. �Barty! I hope you�re ehaving a fabulous day. Take a seat, son.� Barty complied, his eyes moving between the three men.\r      �Why am I here?�\r      �Barty, we don�t know how to tell you this,� Frank began. He held his hands together, looking down.\r      �I�m really sorry, Barty,� Mr. Green said mournfully. �We just have some awful news. It was reported recently��\r      �Your dad is dead,� Loyd finished. �Most likely shot in his car. Not good, not good.�\r      Nothing could have prepared him for this outcome, although death seemed most likely. Mr. Beauregard was nothing if not a good man. Sure, Barty could have assumed, like others, that he had simply run from legal troubles. Kelly once suggested that Barty�s father had a gambling problem and needed to hide. But Barty knew better than all the rest. No, his father would come home no matter what. Barty hated the truth, but it stood that only a tragedy would keep his father away. Even knowing this, Barty�s heart stopped.\r      �It broke an hour ago, Barty.� Mr. Green, anxious to be of use, leaned into his computer monitor and read aloud. ��Beauregard�s car has been found in Lafreaux, submerged in a tributary of Lake Philippas. No body has been found as of an hour ago. Authorities say the side of the vehicle had been riddled with what appeared to be bullet holes.� I�m afraid, Barty, that the writing is on the walls.�\r      Loyd Webster turned to face Barty directly. �Your father is dead. It is very probable that he was murdered.�\r      The words hit Barty in the face. Murdered. Could this truly be?\r      �But they didn�t find his body?� Barty argued. �How can you say he�s dead without his body?�\r      Frank, sympathetically, began to explain. �Barty, it�s obvious to us. Legally, it�s not enough to declare him dead. But our company cannot continue paying for your care, considering the circumstances.�\r      �The police are searching the rivers and surrounding woods,� Loyd explained. �Even if they don�t find him, there�s enough evidence to suggest that he won�t be returning to us.�\r      Barty�s mind reeled with questions. Would Sarah be able to take care of him anymore? What would happen to him now?\r      Frank spoke again. �I spoke to Judge Carson. He�s in charge of your case��\r      Barty stood up at these words. �My case? What do you mean?�\r      All three of the adults in the room traded looks, as if wondering who should speak.\r      Frank leaned forward to where Barty stood. �Barty, unless your dad is found, you will become a ward of the state.�\r      A ward of the state, Barty heard the words and repeated them in his mind. How could this have happened? �Doesn�t he have a will? Didn�t he make plans for this?� Barty sounded desperate, because he felt that way. \r      �There is a will,� Frank continued. �But it doesn�t go into effect unless he�s dead.�\r      �So where will I go?� Barty questioned.\r      Loyd spoke again. �If your dad doesn�t turn up within seven days, you will go into the Child Welfare Department�s care. From there, we cannot guarantee what will happen. But Sarah does not have permanent legal guardianship over you.� Barty appreciated the blunt way that he spoke, even if it came across the wrong way. No B.S.\r      The two attorneys left the office after saying their goodbyes. Barty did not know what to think. Seven days. No body.\r      �Barty,� Mr. Green began. �I�ve been told that you�ve been snooping around the school, asking questions, and things of the sort. Hiding in closets and such.�\r      Barty looked up at him. Why are you asking me about this? He thought.\r      The principal continued. �I would like to encourage you not to look for trouble. Mont Linola Junior High is a good, safe school. We don�t have ghosts lurking around every corner, young man.� He peered down on Barty, as if trying to read his face.\r      Barty felt indignant. He had just been informed that his father had likely been murdered, but Mr. Green seemed concerned about the school�s reputation.\r      �Principal Green,� he replied. �Ghosts are just people hiding in the dark.�\r      The principal's eyes grew wide. �Well,� he said softly. �I�m sure if anyone is hiding anything, I will be sure to find out.�\r      Barty understood. �I�m sure you will.� They stared at each other, waiting for the other to move. Then, Mr. Green flinched, making room for Barty to leave.\r      Walking through the hallway felt like a walk in the spotlight. The walls and lockers appeared darker than normal. Students stopped and watched as Barty made his way to his locker to collect his things. News traveled fast, but how could everyone at school already know?\r      Though a class waited for him, he did not walk there. Instead, he wandered aimlessly, as if guided by a force he did not know. Turning a corner, he moved into the main corridor of the school, lined with posters and displays, highlighting the school�s achievements. In one lit case, he saw trophies from the football team�s most recent year. Gold metal glistened against the lights, filling the case with a warm glow. A wall next to the shelf displayed pictures from each year�s previous team. The chess team even had a panel.\r      Looking for a glimmer of hope, he perused the different sections until he found the bulletin board that featured the swim team. Mont Linola Junior High did not have a swim team until 1998, when the school built the indoor pool. Pictures of each team filled the board in a grid, the year and awards listed on engraved plaques under the framed photos.\r      1998, 1999, Barty read to himself. He did not expect to see the year 2000. And indeed, he did not. The photo had been skipped over. Who�s hiding at Mont Linola? He thought to himself. \r      Almost automatically, his eyes wandered to the photo of the year before. One girl stuck out like a sore thumb; his mother. He knew her instantly, her mixed girl curls and brown skin, darkened by exposure to the sun. He had seen her face in the 1999 yearbook as well as his own family photos, taken in a mall somewhere long before he could remember.\r      If something did not turn up soon, he would have to live someone. Who would he go to? His father had not spoken about her side of the family much. Most of his family seemed like strangers. Barty�s grandparents had died already, and he had been an only child.\r      I am� an orphan. He thought, a tear forming on his cheek. \r      �Barty Beauregard.� A voice interrupted his moment of silence.\r      Barty turned to see a boy, about his own height, standing in the distance. He had neatly brushed, black hair that looked wet. His eyes drooped, dark circles resting beneath them as if he had an iron deficiency. He looked tired.\r      �Gabe De Vera?� Barty returned, quickly wiping the tear from his cheek with his shoulder.\r      Barty had not noticed Mildred, standing behind him. He had fixated on the boy, the answer to his questions. But now, he realized that she must have retrieved him. She looked at him, almost communicating silently with her eyes.\r      �Yes, that�s me.� He looked over his shoulder meekly. �She said you needed to see me.�\r      Barty thought for a moment. How would he ask what he needed to know? How did one go about asking about another�s possible dead sister?\r      �Gabe, do you have any siblings?� He thought this seemed innocuous enough.\r      Gabe�s eyes darted left and right, thinking about the questions as if trying to read Barty�s mind. �I�I do.� He stuttered. �I have a sister, Fionna, and a brother, Donni.�\r      He moved closer to Gabe, like a lion closing in on his prey. �Gabe, I should have been more specific.� he paused for a moment. �Dead siblings?�\r      The boy looked frightened for a moment, as if Barty had looked deep into his soul. And indeed, Barty�s eyes seemed brighter, as if they had an internal light.\r      �I have a sister that died, but I never met her.� At this, Barty could feel the wheels turning in his mind. Finally, he could find an answer to the question of Laurie�s appearance. Laurie, who had not been seen since the day she glowed bright in the Hell Hall, seemed to plague him every moment.\r      �Her name was Melora,� Barty spoke low.\r      Nothing came for a split second, making him question his frankness. Then, the words came from Gabe in a slow, soft answer. �Yes. How did you know that?�",

        "text": "CHAPTER NINE\rThe Three Visitors\r      Barty had little time to process the events at Mont Linola Junior High. His life, already broken in a million pieces, had again been stirred by the invisible spoon of fate. And yet, sometimes he wondered whether the spoon had been attached to some other force, some person or deity bound on making a mess of his school years.\r      Upon arriving at home, he immediately changed and broke out his notebook. He began scribbling out all of the thoughts and events that had occurred during the previous few weeks. A ghost had met him in the Hell Hall. At least, he felt sure that it had been a ghost. Could she have been someone pretending to be the ghost of Melora Freedman? This could have been true, but at least now he could tie the two identities together.\r\tHe lifted his leg and examined the place where the old hag had bitten him. Where once a circle of cuts had stained his pants, only fresh skin existed. Miraculously, the scars had disappeared. Interesting, he thought. But at this point, he knew better than to write the incident off as a hallucination.\r\tDead, dead, dead� the woman had said.\r\tCoinciding with this thought, three knocks came from the living room door. Then, feet shuffled to answer. Barty could hear Sarah�s voice from down the hall. �Oh, hi! Come in. Do you want coffee?�\r\tBarty did not have to wonder who this could be. He already knew. Someone had found his dad�s car in a river. Now, the investigation would begin.\r      �Does your dad have any enemies?� the detective asked, his moustache bouncing up and down with every word.\r      They sat at the dining room table in Barty�s home as the boy thought about the question. He could not think of a single person that would hate his father. In fact, he could recall on one hand the number of times his father had spoken ill of someone.\r      There had been times when he dueled with teachers. Barty, when younger, brought trouble upon himself for arguing with them in class. �He was right, though,� he would say.\r      �But he corrected me in front of the class, Mr. Beauregard,� his fourth grade teacher replied.\r      �And?� Barty�s dad had a way of speaking. �Do you want to be embarrassed or ignorant? I don't understand.�\r      Barry understood his teachers did not appreciate this type of direct confrontation. Would one of them have killed him over it? Certainly not.\r      �Not that I can think of,� Barty replied to the officer.\r      Detective Sheff did not wear a trenchcoat, like Sherlock Holmes. Instead, he wore a white fishing shirt and blue jeans. On his feet, the leftovers of an alligator slept, shaped into brown pointed boots. His face seemed to be stuck in a skeptical scowl.\r      �What about girlfriends?� The detective continued prodding. �Did he ever go on dates or meet anyone?�\r      Barry thought about it. He could not recall the last time his dad had taken someone out. Once, Sarah had come to sit with him while his dad went on a date. When the man returned, he immediately changed clothes and slumped in his chair. �That was a big mistake, Barty.� He looked rough, beaten up.\r      This had been years ago, and Barty certainly could not remember anything about the woman.\r      �Not for a long time,� he stated, wondering if his dad missed being in love.\r      Detective Sheff looked at another police officer standing in the room. Then, he pulled out a photo and laid it on the table. There, a screen capture from a security camera showed Andrew Beauregard, seated at a table across from a woman. She wore a scarf around her head and colorful, flowing fabric for clothes. Her earrings, large gold medallions, reflected the bright sunlight.\r      �This was taken at Cafe Lagrange,� the detective stated. �Do you recognize her?�\r      Barty stared at the photo, trying to read his father�s body language. In a way, his smile seemed relaxed, but his seated position appeared hunched forward, focused. If anything, Barty could tell that his dad did not look at ease. He appeared nervous. He wore his typical attire�a collared plaid button up and navy blue chico pants. If the camera had captured a moment from a date, Andrew Beauregard had not gone out of his way to look more impressive than he did every day.\r      �I don�t know her,� Barty replied. �Who is she?�\r      Detective Scheff�s face twisted into a smile for perhaps the first time since entering the house. �Adoline Garbotholow. She�s batshit crazy, I can tell you that.�\r      Barty sat up when he heard the name. �The spiritualist?�\r      �She�s a fortune teller or something. As far as I�m concerned, she�s a total fraud. I don�t believe in the stuff myself,� the detective replied. �You sure you don�t know her?�\r      Barty thought back to the library. He recalled reading about her from the biography on the school computer�that day. It was the day that the woman chased him in the library. He could still remember the claw-like nails that nearly cut his neck. He could feel her cold, lifeless fingers wringing his neck.\r      �Barty?� Sheff said, trying to make the boy snap back to attention. This worked. Barty jerked back to life, suddenly wide awake.\r      �The lady that owns the antique shop by the lakefront told me about her.�\r      The detective picked up the photo and returned it into a manilla folder. Then, he pulled a card out of his pocket and placed it in front of Barty. �Call me if you think of something.� He stood up to leave, then paused, staring at the boy. �Call me if you need anything. Anything at all. I�m going to figure this out. When I do, we will bring whoever did this to justice.�\r      When he had finally gone, Barty got up to leave the table.\r      �Barty, do you want dinner?� Sarah called out after him as he walked down the hall.\r      �No,� he replied. He had other things on his mind.\r      He returned to the notebook, spread out on his desk. Adoline Garbotholow, he thought, writing the words on the page. The fact that his father had met her did not necessarily mean anything. But why would his dad have neglected to mention it?\r      Then, Barty heard three more knocks on the door. Again, feet shuffled to answer.\r      �Oh, hello, Miss Higgins,� Sarah said, opening the door. �Yes, come on in. Do you want some coffee?�\r      This time, Barty could not be sure who Miss Higgins could be. He made his way down the hall as the tall, slender woman entered the home. She looked around, almost intentionally investigating, when she met eyes with him. �Oh, are you Barty?�\r      He had never met a woman so tall and commanding. She wore a black leather jacket, blue jeans, and a giant gun at her side. Her voice sounded like something out of an old western. Indeed, she looked the part. Around her neck, a badge hung that read �Darcy Higgins, DCFS.� \r      �I am,� Barty replied, still taking in the sight of her.\r      They again sat at the table, while the woman looked over a pile of papers. She asked dozens of questions about Barty and Sarah�s life. It seemed as if she wanted to know everything about him, even his dietary preferences.\r      �Mont Linola Junior High,� Sarah responded. �Thirteen� June twenty-first, 2010.�\r      �And you, Barty,� she said, turning to him. �You feel safe with Sarah?�\r      He looked at his caretaker. Her mouth hung open for the first time that afternoon. Then, he replied to Darcy Higgins, �I feel as safe as any boy could feel, considering the facts.�\r      �What are the facts, Barty?� She returned, cooly.\r      �Someone killed my dad, right?�\r      The woman smiled at him. Not a smile of satisfaction or joy. This smile meant, �I know you don�t believe that. You�re smarter than you look.�\r      �Right.� She looked at Sarah and sighed. �You don�t have guardianship over him beyond your employment with his company. That�s going to end soon, so Barty is going to have to go to someone that we can verify is related to him. Either that, or he�ll have to go into one of our foster homes.�\r      Sarah nearly leapt out of her chair. Standing, she walked behind Barty, ready to grab him and run. �No! There�s no way I�ll let that happen.�\r      Darcy stood up, ready to leave. �It�s not up to you, Miss Badeaux. It�s the way it has to be. Now look, he has family on his mother�s side. They don�t too far away. Maybe you can keep in contact once we�ve placed him in a stable home.� She walked to the door and opened it. �I�ll be in touch.�\r      Barty remembered the Family Reunion invitation that Mrs. Prescott had given him. He wondered what a family reunion might look like on his mothers side. �Your mom was Creole,� his dad had told him. Barty understood this as a great blend of cultures, some Native and some European. It meant a gumbo of French, English, Spanish, African, and Native American. Mixed, he thought.\r      Mr. Beauregard had lined the house with family pictures of Barty�s mom, Tula. However, the professional family portraits stopped when she died. In their stead, pictures of vacations, go kart outings, and fancy dinners had taken their place. Mr. Beauregard could not replace Tula, but he did his best to make sure Barty had a good childhood.\r      Barty always marveled at how beautiful his mother appeared. She had soft, light brown skin and curly dark hair that fell when long enough. She looked lean and tall, with high cheekbones. And she smiled in every picture. Barty felt sure that if she had been alive, he would certainly enjoy being with her.\r      But why had he not met any of her family? Why had Andrew Beauregard kept this part of his family away? He had rarely thought about this at home. He just thought it was normal. But now, a thirteen year old experiencing disillusionment, he realized this could not be normal. Unless, of course, something had happened. Perhaps, his father had a falling out with her family. But what could have happened?\r      Sarah laid her head down on the table, and beat it with her fist. �Barty, this is the worst.� When she raised her head again, tears had filled her eyes.\r      �I know,� Barty replied. �No one wants to drink your coffee.�\r      He started walking back to his room, slowly. The light bulb in the middle of the hall had begun to flicker. Then, with a popping sound, it went dark. Barty walked to the lightswitch and started flipping it up and down, but the fixture did not respond. He breathed out loudly, knowing that the bulb would need to be replaced.\r      On the right side of the hallway, from under a door, a blue light stretched across the wood of the floorboards. Several times a day, Barty passed this doorway on the way to his room. It led to his father�s home office, a room that Barty dared not enter without permission. �You�re not allowed in here without me,� his father had said. �I�ve got a lot of records from a lot of clients here, and it�s all very confidential.� Now, Barty wondered whether the rules applied if his dad could not enforce them.\r      For the first time since seeing his father at home, Barty put his hand on the brass knob. It felt cold, unused. As he applied pressure to turn the metallic ball, it stuck a little. Are you sure? It asked. I am, Barty replied. He applied slightly more pressure and felt the mechanism give way with a clicking feeling. Then, the door opened freely. \r      Barty pushed the door into the office and stepped inside. The room felt cold and untouched. His dad�s desk had papers sprawled all over the top of it. Bookshelves lined one wall, and a single window allowed moonlight to enter the room. \r      Barty walked around to the other side of the desk and sat in the large, black computer chair. He could smell the faint traces of his father�s cologne on the leather of the chair, taking him back to when his dad could still hold him. He momentarily paused, leaning back into the chair and closing his eyes.\r      Then, after a moment, he opened them. He saw everything in the room. Supernatural light seemed to guide him. One particular book glowed in the darkness. Barty had not seen it there, and indeed he had not previously needed to.\r      He walked around the desk again to the shelves of books lining the wall opposite the desk. Then, he squatted down and squinted in concentration. There, on the bottom shelf, his dad kept old magazines, photo albums, and memorabilia. Along with hobby books and collector sets, he kept a copy of a navy blue book. On its spine, Barty could see the gold letters that read Mont Linola Junior High School, 1999.\r      As he began to reach out and grab the book, someone knocked on the door three times. He looked at the source and whispered, �Yes, Sarah?�\r      No answer returned.\r      Barry stood and walked to open the door. When he pulled it open, he found no one on the other side. His hands shook as he ushered the door to its place. Maybe I imagined it, he thought. \r      �What are you doing in this room?� A familiar voice asked.\r      Barry would have jumped had his blood not run cold. Slowly, his body swiveled to look at the person. Slumped in the black chair, a man sat, wearing a tattered plaid shirt. His straight black hair ran into his face in wet bunches that led to strings of water. The man looked like he had just stood up in a pool, dripping at every sharp point on his body.\r      �I told you never to come in here without me,� he continued.\r      Barty�s words became lodged in his throat. He knew this man. He knew his eyes, his hands, and the gold digital watch that clung to his wrist. He knew immediately by the sound of his voice and the way he slumped in the chair, tired and ready to rest.\r      The familiarity did not scare him. No, it was the unfamiliar that cut deep. He did not recognize the bags under the man�s eyes or the way his chest heaved up and down with labored breaths. He had never seen the bloodshot, half open eyes of a the man, strangled with pain.\r      �Are you going to,� the man coughed, and, as he did, water came out of every hole on his face. �Say something?�\r      �I�m,� Barty choked. �I�m sorry, dad.�\r      The man glared at him, not in an angry way. He looked disappointed, but in what Barty did not know. Had his face not already been wet from whatever water had taken him, tears would have been there.\r      �It�s not your fault,� the man returned, attempting to sit up. He slipped as he pushed up on the arms of the chair. As he did, his hands seemed to pass through the plastic arm rests, offering no support.\r      Barty inched closer, hoping to make the man see him again. Closer now, he could see the clothing covered in dirt and tears and blood. Bits of grass and pine needles lay like remnants of a roll on the ground.\r      Finally, Andrew stood. His legs passed through the chair like water, and he walked around the desk to where Barty stood. His feet made squishing noises, leaving wet footprints in the carpet.\r      �You hate being wet,� he said, almost smiling.\r      Barry could not hold the tears back any longer. He started to cry, as he did, he threw himself forward into the man�s torso. His father wrapped his arms around him and squeezed. They stayed that way, softly crying in each others arms, knowing the truth. Barty instinctively understood that this would be his last chance to feel the warmth of his father�s embrace. However, after the minutes passed, only cold, like a wet winter coat, came from the man�s body. \r      �I�m so sorry, son. I�m so sorry,� the man cried, resting his head on Barty�s curly tufts of hair. �I should have come home. I should have��\r      �You should have what?� Barty questioned, almost angrily. He let go and backed away slowly to face the man. �What happened? Who did this to you?�\r      Andrew Beauregard did not respond. He looked straight into the boy�s face for a moment before drifting off into silent memory. He looked through Barty,  studying the nothingness of the moment.\r      �Dad?� Barty spoke again.\r      �I don�t know.�\r      �You don�t know?� Barty repeated. This had not been the answer he hoped for. In this moment, he felt as if all of his questions could be settled, but his father�s response indicated differently.\r      �Dad, I need to know everything you remember. I need to know. I have to find out who�� his voice drifted off, not wanting to finish the sentence.\r      �Who killed me?� Andrew finished. �Barty, there�s a lot you don�t know. God, there's a lot I don�t know. I was driving, and I heard gunshots. And everything went black.�\r      �Where were you?� Batty prodded.\r      �I was� I was�� he stumbled, grabbing his midsection. Then, he lurched forward and vomited. A fast stream of water sprayed from his mouth and filled the floor. �I�m dead, Barty! I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead�� He started wailing and hyperventilating. �I�m dead! I died, Barty! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!�\r      Barry walked forward, reaching for his icy hand. He too cried, but softly, trying to remain in control. �It�s okay, dad. I'm fine. I'll be okay.� Barty knew this to be a lie. He did not feel capable of working out the issues before him. He felt alone.\r      �You will,� the man replied. �You�re strong.�\r      Barry did not say anything in response. Instead, he thought carefully about the words he should utter next. He longed to savor this moment, however horrible, and simply exist with his father. He wanted to reminisce and laugh and suggest watching an episode of Go Fireboy, Go. But the questions loomed too loudly. He needed answers. His father dying, or, rather dead, had little time. Instinctively, Barty knew he would only have this moment before his dad would vanish into the eternity beyond.\r      �Dad, I am going to find out what happened. I promise you. And I'm going to make it right,� Barty said. He looked at his father in the face, catching his attention. �You have to tell me everything you know about what I ask. Okay?�\r      His father nodded. �I�ll try. No, wait,� he snapped back to attention, coughing and wheezing. �You can�t, son. Don't get involved with this. Leave it to the police.�\r      Barty met his eyes with frightening determination. �I will do what I want. You said it yourself. I'm strong. And I will remind you. I'm smart. I'm smart enough to stay safe. I'm smart enough to ask for help.�\r      The man�s face transformed, fear overtaking him. Barty�s eyes had begun to glow bright white, as if something inside of him had lit ablaze.\r      �Andrew, I can fix this if you tell me what you did.� The boy�s voice had also begun changing. It sounded deeper, fuller, as if another spoke through him. �Who is Melora Freedman?� \r      The man backed away, fear covering him as fully as the water in which he died. �She�s a girl that died when I was in school,� he gagged, holding his stomach. \r      Batty stood straight, emotionless. �How did you know her?�\r      �I can�t,� Andrew replied.\r      �You can,� Barty commanded. �Tell me now before it's too late!�\r      �I can�t, Barty! I won't!� The man�s voice rose, breaking through the pain. �I swore!�\r      �Andrew Beauregard,� Barty spoke, growing tall and dark. �Tell me what you did.�\r      The father shrank, curling up against the wall. He shook uncontrollably as his body seemed to twist and shrivel. Then, his face morphed into a thin, skull-like figure with eyes dead and dark. �I�� he breathed a deep breath, preparing to scream, �SWOOOORE!� He let out the final word like a battlecry, a demon�s roar. The room shook, and the moonlight came upon him, revealing skin, bruised and riddled with thick purple veins.\r      Barty, face dark and menacing, looked upon him with supernatural eyes, shining in the darkness. Then, he shrunk, returning to his normal appearance, the look of a boy helpless before oncoming doom.\r      A train whistle echoed in the night air, breaking the silence of the moment. Both recognized how quiet the room had been. Now, the low rumbling rhythm of the train could be heard. Then, breathless and helpless, Andrew Beauregard broke the stillness with a whisper of a voice. �I have to go.� He struggled for breath. �Will you go with me to the train? I can't leave without you.�\r      Barty studied him. His appearance had become soft again, masking the demon inside. Whatever lay under the surface had been more devastating than anything Barty knew about the man.\r      �I will go with you. But I don't where.� Tears again fell down his cheeks. �Do you have to go?�\r      The man leaned forward into a crawl, grasping for the desk. He pulled himself up and limped to the other side of the room. �I don�t know either, Barty. All I know is I hurt. I can't exist like this anymore. I want to find your mom. I want to feel better. I need to go on. I just had to see you one more time.�\r      Barry wiped his face with his shoulder. He swallowed, accepting the situation. �Why now? Why wait? You knew I could see. You let me think I was crazy.�\r      The man looked down at the shelf that held the yearbook. �I�ve been here, Barty. The whole time. You've been too good to disobey, to come in here. Something changed in you, and,� he paused, eyes locked on the yearbook. �I�m afraid.�\r      �Afraid of what?� Barty questioned.\r      �Afraid of what you will become. It�s in your blood.�\r      He looked at Barty again, desperate and afraid. �In that book, you're going to learn things that I can't say out loud. Just know I love you. I hope you don�t hate me. I hope you forgive me.� Barry nodded agreement.\r      He took his fathers hand and quietly led him out. They walked through the living room, where Sarah had passed out on the red couch, the TV still running episodes of an old black and white program. Then, quietly, Barty opened the front door and stepped out into the night, still holding his father�s ghostly hand. A soft breeze welcomed him into the wilderness of the dark.\r      When they walked, the elder Beauregard leaned against the boy for support. The man lowered himself down the stair of the porch, grasping at the wooden column to steady himself.\r      �Why can I touch you?� Barty asked. He had wondered this for some time.\r      �Probably for the same reason you can see me,� replied his father. \r      This felt like less of an answer and more of an observation. �But why? Why can I see you at all?�\r      His father thought for a moment as they hobbled down the driveway together. They turned right on the street in the direction of the dead end. �I don�t really know. Your grandfather, Lucious, will know more about it.�\r      They walked in silence, under the orange lamplight that bathed only a few spots on the road. The houses slept silently on the sides of the street, like  giants. Barty hoped not to disturb them or draw attention. He wondered how odd it might appear to his neighbors that he would be walking alone at night toward the Trail.\r      In front of them, like a siren�s song, the train grew louder, filling the atmosphere with thumping. They reached the place where the asphalt ended and transitioned to weeds, leaves, and trees. But through the clearing, the place where Barty and his neighbors pushed through to the Trail, black shadows shifted and glimmered, speeding past the trees. It was the train.\r      The chugging had grown so loud now that Barty immediately resisted the urge to cover his ears. He could not while he still supported his father. Together, they hiked down through the dip in the wood, through the trees. Then, Barty could see it.\r      As far as he could see in both directions, the train stretched on, with boxcars and passenger cars whizzing past. The passenger sections glowed from within with warm light through round windows. The light from these hit Barty in the face repeatedly as it alternated with shadows.\r      At once, a dark wonder took hold of the boy and he felt afraid. It seemed like a new world had opened for him, a world of demons and ghosts and magic and� death. In this world, Barty�s father lived, or rather, lingered. It was the world in which his father would depart, where Barty himself might not visit until the end.\r      �I love you, son,� Andrew Beauregard shouted over the sound of the train. He looked down at the boy, his face shriveled in grief.\r      Barty looked at him in the face and loved him. He had bags under his eyes and dirt on his cheeks, but still, he remained his father, the man that had single handedly carved a path forward for them. This man comforted him through sickness and provided for him. This man had been his rock and protector for thirteen years. In the end, Barty realized that this man needed protecting himself, and no one had done it.\r      �I love you,� Barty replied, though he did not shout. He could hardly speak. \r      His father nodded and walked forward to where the train met the grass. He held out his hand and raised his thumb. Barty flinched as parts of the train came flying by the man�s head. How silly, he thought. He�s dead.\r      Then, as if in response, some devilish hand reached out of a boxcar and met Andrew Beauregard�s in the air. It grabbed him furiously, yanking the ghost and pulling him into the container like a rag doll.\r      Barty could no longer see him. He stood there and watched the train, knowing that no train had run in St. Fischer Parish for more than several decades. \r      When finally the train disappeared, and Barty had done all the crying he could, he walked back to his home, opened the door, and went to bed. He knew the yearbook waited to be read, studied, and investigated. Not tonight, he said to himself. Not tonight.",

        "text": "CHAPTER TEN\rMont Linola Junior Highschool, 2000\r      �So, I�ve been thinking,� Kelly Prescott said.\r      She caught Barty as he began his daily ascent up the steps of Mont Linola Junior High. Not now, he thought. The last thing Barty needed was another joke from Kelly Prescott. He continued walking forward, pretending to not see her.\r      �Barty!� she said a little louder. �Barty Beauregard!�\r      Barty stopped moving and closed his eyes. �What, Kelly?�\r      �I�ve been thinking,� she began again.\r      You could have fooled me, Barty thought.\r      �In light of everything going on with our situation,� she continued.\r      �Our situation?� Barty repeated. �You mean the situation with my dad?�\r      �Exactly,� she replied. �I mean with the fact that we�re family and all. And the fact that your dad just died��\r      Barty knew where this would end. �I get it, Kelly. I really do. Don�t even worry about it.� He hated the idea of hearing the words out loud. Talking felt like a burden. In fact, listening seemed like too much effort.\r      �It would just seem so weird if��\r      �We went to the dance together,� Barty interrupted. �I get it.� He continued walking forward, the conversation finished.\r      Her cheeks turned as pink as her bow. �No!� She burst this out. Then, cutting him off mid-walk, she stood directly in front of him.\r      �Move, Kelly.� Barty had had enough.\r      �No, Barty. If you think I�m going to break it off with the loser kid, especially after his dad just dies, you�re dumber than a bag of bricks, Barty Beauregard! Especially if we�re family. Cousins go to dances together all the time!�\r      Too stunned to speak, his face froze. How could she think this a good time to drop this on him? How could she be this obtuse? A million thoughts swam to the surface of his mind, most of them wildly inappropriate.\r      �KELLY!� Barty shouted this, and when the echo returned to his ears, every eye had turned to watch. �I�m not going to the dance with you! I was NEVER going to go with you! I just didn�t know how to get out of it. But I know now. This is it. Leave me alone!�\r      She froze. Instead of pink, her face now looked a dark shade of red. She stayed stuck like this for almost a minute before Barty said anything again.\r      �Get it?� Barty demanded.\r      An individual tear started down her face. Then, when she could finally speak, she bit her lip and growled. �Fine,� she said, slightly whimpering between words. �If this is how you want to do it, I can do it as well.� With a loud bark of a shout, she grabbed his shirt and shoved him backward. \r      Unable to react, he fell onto his back, flattening his backpack. Before he could rise, a loud scream trailed over his head like a battle cry. Black basketball sneakers launched over him. \r      �You�� Mildred screamed a nasty name and threw herself at Kelly�s exiting body, thrusting the girl to the ground by the bow in her hair.\r      Barty sat up in time to watch Kelly realize what hit her. She turned over and crawled to her feet as the Preppy Pinks quickly ran to help. �I�m fine!� She shrieked, straightening her hair. �Let me punch the witch that touched me!�\r      Mildred stood directly in her line of sight, glaring menacingly. She held out her fists, looking rather ridiculous. Kelly recoiled, afraid to advance. Mildred stepped forward, invading Kelly�s space. �Touch my friend again, and I�ll rip your hair out.�\r      �Detention!� A voice shouted out over the crowded students in the hall. �Detention for all of you!� Coach Grant tore through the kids, speedwalking like an Olympian.\r      �Coach!� Mildred cried. �She attacked him. You had to see that!�\r      Barty, still on the ground, felt his head beginning to heat. A crowd had simultaneously paused to watch. Red-faced, Kelly rushed forward to plead her case. �I didn�t touch the dweeb!�\r      The two began going back and forth, steadily growing louder until they might have thrown blows again. Coach Grant, in his squealy voice, began yelling over them. �Alright, alright. ALRIGHT! I said STOP!� The two girls, steam drifting off their skin, glared into each other�s eyes.\r      �I don�t care who started it! You all get detention. After school.� He looked around at the scene that they had created. He looked even angrier, which looked silly on his frail body. �Break it up! Go to class! Shew!� Then, he marched away, as Mildred and Kelly mouthed curse words at each other and collected their things.\r      Barty began walking to class without speaking to Mildred. She quickly shuffled to catch up to him, but he did not acknowledge her. �Barty, I�m sorry.�\r      He glanced in her direction, still stepping. �I don�t care. Forget it.�\r      She followed closely behind, trying to match his urgency. �What happened yesterday?�\r      �I can�t say everything now,� he replied. �Let�s talk at lunch.�\r      �See you then,� she said before parting ways.\r\r\t\r      \r      \r      2\r      \r      \r      \r      \r      \r      Cory Gilford - Barty Beauregard and the Fabulous Fraud - 1",
