The rise of artificial intelligence has transformed Silicon Valley. At OpenAI's headquarters in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman announced GPT-5, while Microsoft's $50B investment through CEO Satya Nadella signaled major changes. @elonmusk, posting on X (formerly Twitter), criticized the move: "AGI requires more oversight." Google's DeepMind, led by Demis Hassabis in London, accelerated their research. Meanwhile, Jeff Dean at Google Brain merged with DeepMind to form Google AGI.

The announcement caused $MSFT stock to jump 15%, while $GOOGL saw a 7% increase. Anthropic's Claude 3, developed under Dario Amodei and Paul Christiano, demonstrated new capabilities. Stanford's AI Safety Institute, funded by Dustin Moskovitz through @OpenPhil, launched ethics guidelines.

At Berkeley's CHAI (Center for Human-Compatible AI), Prof. Stuart Russell collaborated with @AnthropicAI researchers. The #AISafety and #AGIControl hashtags trended worldwide.
