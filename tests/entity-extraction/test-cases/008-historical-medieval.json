    "text": "The Treaty of Troyes (1420) marked a pivotal moment in the Hundred Years' War when King Charles VI of France, often called 'Charles the Mad', agreed to disinherit his son Charles (later Charles VII) in favor of King Henry V of England. The treaty arranged the marriage of Henry V to Catherine of Valois, Charles VI's daughter, making their future son, Henry VI, heir to both the English and French thrones. The Dauphin Charles, supported by Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), would later challenge this arrangement. During this period, Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, allied with the English following the assassination of his father, John the Fearless, at the Bridge of Montereau. The House of Valois-Burgundy, a cadet branch of the French royal house, controlled territories stretching from Dijon to the Low Countries. In Paris, the University scholars, led by Jean Gerson, Chancellor of the University of Paris, debated the legitimacy of the treaty, while at the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the traditional burial place of French kings, preparations were made for what many saw as the union of two great kingdoms. The Armagnac faction, led by Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, and supported by the powerful House of Orléans, continued to resist English dominion from their strongholds in southern France.",
