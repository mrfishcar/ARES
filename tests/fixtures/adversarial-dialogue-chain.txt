The council chamber was silent as Lord Marcus Blackwood took his seat at the head of the table.
Across from him sat Lady Elena Blackwood, his estranged wife. Between them, their son Thomas fidgeted nervously.

"We need to discuss the inheritance," Lord Marcus said.

"There's nothing to discuss," Elena replied coldly. "The estate goes to Thomas."

"That's precisely the problem."

Thomas looked up. "What do you mean, Father?"

"Your mother hasn't told you everything."

"What haven't you told me?" Thomas turned to face her.

"Don't listen to him." Her voice was sharp.

"Then explain yourself."

"I will when the time is right."

"The time is now," Lord Marcus insisted.

"You have no authority here."

"I have every authority. This is still my house."

"Not for long."

Thomas slammed his fist on the table. "Enough! Both of you, stop this."

"You don't understand what's at stake," his father said quietly.

"Then make me understand."

Elena stood abruptly. "This meeting is over."

"Sit down, Mother."

"Don't tell me what to do."

"Someone has to act like an adult here."

Lord Marcus smiled grimly. "The boy has a point, Elena."

"He's not a boy anymore. That's the problem."

"That's exactly my point," Thomas said. "I deserve to know the truth."

"The truth is complicated," Elena admitted finally.

"Lies are complicated. Truth is simple."

Lord Marcus nodded. "For once, I agree with your mother's sentiment, even if not her methods."

"Will someone just tell me what's going on?"

"Your grandfather," Elena began slowly, "made certain... arrangements."

"What kind of arrangements?"

"The kind that bind across generations."

Thomas felt cold. "What does that mean?"

"It means," his father said, "that the estate isn't really ours to give."

"Then whose is it?"

Neither parent answered.

"Whose. Is. It?"

Elena finally spoke. "It belongs to the Warden of the Northern March."

"There is no Warden. That title died with Grandfather."

"No," Lord Marcus said quietly. "It didn't."

Thomas stared at them both. "One of you is the Warden?"

"No," they said together.

"Then who?"

Lord Marcus looked at his son. "You are."
