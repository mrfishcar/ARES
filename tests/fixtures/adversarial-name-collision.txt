Professor John Hartley arrived at the conference hall precisely at nine. His colleague, John Williams, was already waiting by the registration desk.

"John!" called Professor Hartley. "Over here!"

Dr. Williams turned and waved. He had been Professor Williams at Cambridge before taking the research position.

The conference organizer, a young woman named Sarah, approached the two Johns. "Professors, your panel is in Room 302."

"Thank you, Sarah," said Hartley.

Williams nodded. "Is Professor Chen here yet?"

"Dr. Chen arrived this morning. She's in the speaker lounge."

The two professors walked together toward the elevator. Hartley was thinking about his presentation on medieval texts, while Williams reviewed his notes on quantum computing.

"John, did you read Chen's latest paper?" Williams asked.

"Which one? The one on neural networks or the one on climate models?"

"The climate one. It references your work."

Hartley smiled. "She's building on the wrong John's work. That was your paper on atmospheric modeling."

"No, she cited your historical temperature reconstructions."

"Ah. I hadn't noticed."

In the speaker lounge, Dr. Margaret Chen was reviewing slides with Professor Hartley's graduate student, also named John - John Peterson.

"John, these graphs need labels," Chen told the young man.

"I'll fix them before Professor Hartley's panel."

"Which Professor? Hartley or Williams?"

Peterson looked confused. "Professor Hartley. John Hartley. My advisor."

"Of course. I get the Johns confused."

When the elder Hartley entered the lounge, he saw Chen speaking with his student.

"John," he called.

Both John Peterson and John Williams looked up.

"Peterson," Hartley clarified. "The graphs."

"Dr. Chen already told me, Professor."

Williams laughed. "This conference has too many Johns."

"And too many professors," added Chen. "Though I prefer Doctor myself."

Hartley turned to Williams. "We should coordinate. Your panel follows mine."

"Agreed. My John - I mean, my colleague John Rodriguez - is presenting first on my panel."

"Another John?"

"He goes by J.R. to avoid confusion."

Sarah reappeared. "Professors? Dr. Chen? The hall is ready."

The group followed her, a procession of academics with overlapping names and titles, each carrying their own expertise and their own Johns.
