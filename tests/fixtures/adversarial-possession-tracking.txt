In the old shop on Merchant Street, the antique dealer Clara examined the pocket watch. It had belonged to Admiral James Whitmore, according to the inscription.

"I'll take it," said Marcus Grey, placing three gold coins on the counter.

Clara wrapped the watch carefully. "A fine piece. Made in Geneva, 1847."

Marcus left the shop and walked to the harbor. There, his sister Helena was waiting aboard the Seawind.

"A gift for you," Marcus said, pressing the watch into her palm.

Helena smiled. "The Admiral's watch! Where did you find it?"

"Clara's shop. Cost me three golds."

For seven years, Helena carried the watch across the seas. When the Seawind finally returned to port, she was not aboard. First Mate Samuel brought her effects to Marcus.

"She wanted you to have this back," Samuel said, handing over the watch.

Marcus could not bear to look at it. He gave it to the cathedral, where Father Benedict placed it in the reliquary.

Twenty years passed.

Young Thomas Ashford, newly ordained, was cataloging the cathedral's treasures when he found the watch.

"Father Benedict," Thomas called, "what's the story behind this timepiece?"

The old priest smiled sadly. "It belonged to a sailor woman. Helena Grey. Her brother donated it after she was lost at sea."

"May I?" Thomas asked, reaching for it.

"It's church property now. But you may study it."

Thomas did more than study it. When the cathedral was looted during the uprising, he saved the watch from the flames. He kept it hidden in his vestments as he fled to the mountains.

In the refugee camp, Thomas met an old woman who recognized the inscription.

"That was my grandmother's watch," she whispered. "Before the Admiral. Before any of them."

"Your grandmother's?"

"Yes. She was a clockmaker's daughter in Geneva. Her name was Anna Beaumont."

Thomas looked at the watch with new eyes. It had traveled through so many hands: Anna to the Admiral, the Admiral to the shop, the shop to Marcus, Marcus to Helena, Helena back to Marcus, Marcus to the church, the church to Thomas.

"It should return to your family," Thomas said.

The old woman shook her head. "I am the last of us. Keep it. Let it travel further."

Thomas still carries the watch. Sometimes he thinks he can hear it ticking even when it's stopped.
