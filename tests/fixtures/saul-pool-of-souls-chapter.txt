TODO: REPLACE WITH ACTUAL CHAPTER TEXT

This is a placeholder file for the Saul / Pool of Souls chapter from
a long fantasy narrative (possibly from Barty Beauregard and the Fabulous Fraud
or similar work).

This fixture should contain:
- Long narrative prose (~1000-3000 words)
- Multiple characters, locations, items, events
- Complex sentence structures
- Sentence-initial capitalized words that are NOT names
- Action sequences, descriptions, dialogue

The actual text should be pasted here by the user or extracted from the
source document.

Example structure (to be replaced):

Saul walked through the darkened halls of Mount Lola Chapel. The old building
had stood for centuries, weathering storms and sieges alike. Song echoed through
the corridors - an ancient melody that few remembered.

Perched on the ledge above, a raven watched his progress. Like many visitors
before him, Saul sought the Pool of Souls, a mystical artifact said to grant
visions of the past.

Citizens of the nearby town whispered stories about the pool. Learning its
secrets required patience and courage. Questions filled his mind as he descended
the stone staircase.

At the chamber's heart lay the pool, its surface mirror-smooth. Darkness
surrounded it, broken only by flickering torchlight. Familiar symbols covered
the walls - runes he'd seen in old manuscripts.

As Saul knelt beside the pool, he heard footsteps. Someone else had come seeking
answers. The stabbing pain in his chest reminded him of the price knowledge
demanded.

"Hello," said a voice from the shadows. Justice, he realized, would have its day.
